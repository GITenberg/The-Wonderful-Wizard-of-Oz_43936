<p>Folk lore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed
childhood through the ages, for every healthy
youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories
fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The winged
fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness
to childish hearts than all other human creations.</p>

<p>Yet the old-time fairy tale, having served for generations,
may now be classed as "historical" in the children's
library; for the time has come for a series of newer "wonder
tales" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy
are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling
incident devised by their authors to point a
fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes
morality; therefore the modern child
seeks only entertainment in its wonder-tales
and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable
incident.</p>

<p>Having this thought in mind, the
story of "The Wonderful Wizard of
Oz" was written solely to pleasure
children of today. It aspires to being
a modernized fairy tale, in which the
wonderment and joy are retained and the
heart-aches and nightmares are left out.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Dorothy </span>lived in
the midst of the
great Kansas
prairies, with Uncle Henry,
who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was
the farmer's wife. Their house was small,
for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
many miles. There were four walls, a floor
and a roof, which made one room; and this
room contained a rusty looking cooking
stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table,
three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle
Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and
Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret
at all, and no cellar&mdash;except a small hole, dug in the
ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go
in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty
enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached
by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a
ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p>

<p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked
around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie
on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad
sweep of flat country that reached the edge of the sky in
all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a
gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the
grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of
the long blades until they were the same gray color to be
seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but
the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away,
and now the house was as dull and gray as everything
else.</p>

<p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young,
pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too.
They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a
sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and
lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt,
and never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an
orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled
by the child's laughter that she would scream and press
her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice
reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with
wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p>
</div><!--i013-->
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from
morning till night and did not know what joy was. He
was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and
he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>

<p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her
from growing as gray as her other surroundings.
Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog,
with long, silky hair and small black
eyes that twinkled merrily on either side
of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all
day long, and Dorothy played with him,
and loved him dearly.</p>

<p>To-day, however, they were not
playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the
door-step and looked anxiously
at the sky, which was
even grayer than usual. Dorothy
stood in the door with
Toto in her arms, and looked
at the sky too. Aunt Em was
washing the dishes.</p>

<p>From the far
north they heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could
see where the long grass bowed in waves before the
coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in
the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that
way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that
direction also.</p>

<p>Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</p>

<p>"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his
wife; "I'll go look after the stock." Then he ran toward
the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.</p>

<p>Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.
One glance told her of the danger close at hand.</p>

<p>"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed; "run for the cellar!"</p>

<p>Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the
bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly
frightened, threw open the trap-door in the floor and
climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy
caught Toto at last, and started to follow her aunt.
When she was half way across the room there came a great
shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that
she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.</p>

<p>A strange thing then happened.</p>

<p>The house whirled around two or three times and
rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she were
going up in a balloon.</p>

<p>The north and south winds met where the house
stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great
pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up
higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone;
and there it remained and was carried miles and miles
away as easily as you could carry a feather.</p>

<p>It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly
around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily.
After the first few whirls around, and one other time when
the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked
gently, like a baby in a cradle.</p>

<p>Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now
here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite
still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

   <img src="images/i016_edit.jpg" alt="Dorothy and Toto on a bed" title="Dorothy and Toto on a bed" height="805" width="600" />

   <div class="shape_wrap_left">

      <div class="right" style="width: 100%; height: 405px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>Once Toto got too near the open trap-door, and fell in;
and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But
soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole,
for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up
so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught
Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again;
afterward closing the trap-door so that no more accidents
could happen.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy
got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind
shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became
deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed
to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed
and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and
resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would
bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her
bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay
down beside her.</p>

<p>In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing
of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">She </span>was awakened
by a shock, so sudden
and severe that if Dorothy
had not been lying on the soft
bed she might have been hurt.
As it was, the jar made her catch
her breath and wonder what had
happened; and Toto put his cold
little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy
sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was
it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window,
flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and
with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.</p>

<p>The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked
about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful
sights she saw.</p>

</div><!-- i019 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>The cyclone had set the house down, very gently&mdash;for
a cyclone&mdash;in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty.
There were lovely patches of green sward all about, with
stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of
gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare
and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and
bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and
sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a
voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on
the dry, gray prairies.</p>

<p>While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and
beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of
the queerest people she had ever seen. They were not as big
as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither
were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall
as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age,
although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.</p>

<p>Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly
dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point
a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims
that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men
were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she wore
a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders; over it
were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like
diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>shade as their hats, and wore well polished boots with a
deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought,
were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had
beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older:
her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly
white, and she walked rather stiffly.</p>

   </div>

<p>When these people drew near the house where Dorothy
was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered
among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the
little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow
and said, in a sweet voice,</p>

<p>"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land
of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having
killed the wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our
people free from bondage."</p>

<p>Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What
could the little woman possibly
mean by calling her a sorceress,
and saying she had killed the
wicked Witch of the East?
Dorothy was an innocent,
harmless little girl, who had
been carried by a cyclone
many miles from home;
and she had never killed
anything in all her life.</p>

<p>But the little woman
evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with
hesitation,</p>

<p>"You are very kind; but there must be some mistake.
I have not killed anything."</p>
</div><!-- i023 -->
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your house did, anyway," replied the little old
woman, with a laugh; "and that is the same thing. See!"
she continued, pointing to the corner of the house; "there
are her two toes, still sticking out from under a block of
wood."</p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

   </div>


<p>Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There,
indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house
rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes
with pointed toes.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" cried Dorothy, clasping her
hands together in dismay; "the house must have fallen on
her. What ever shall we do?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done," said the little woman,
calmly.</p>

<p>"But who was she?" asked
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"She was the wicked Witch
of the East, as I
said," answered
the little woman.
"She has held all
the Munchkins
in bondage for
many years, making them slave for her night and day.
Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the
favour."</p>

</div><!-- i024 -->
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who are the Munchkins?" enquired Dorothy.</p>

<p>"They are the people who live in this land of the
East, where the wicked Witch ruled."</p>

<p>"Are you a Munchkin?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No; but I am their friend, although I live in the land
of the North. When they saw the Witch of the East was
dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I
came at once. I am the Witch of the North."</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious!" cried Dorothy; "are you a real witch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed;" answered the little woman. "But I
am a good witch, and the people love me. I am not as
powerful as the wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I
should have set the people free myself."</p>

<p>"But I thought all witches were wicked," said the
girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; that is a great mistake. There were only
four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those
who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I
know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot
be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the West
were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed
one of them, there is but one wicked Witch in all the Land
of Oz&mdash;the one who lives in the West."</p>

<p>"But," said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Em has told me that the witches were all dead&mdash;years and
years ago."</p>

<p>"Who is Aunt Em?" inquired the little old woman.</p>

<p>"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came
from."</p>

<p>The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time,
with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground. Then
she looked up and said,</p>

<p>"I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard
that country mentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized
country?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes;" replied Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries
I believe there are no witches left; nor wizards, nor sorceresses,
nor magicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has
never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of
the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards
amongst us."</p>

<p>"Who are the Wizards?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Oz himself is the Great Wizard," answered the
Witch, sinking her voice to a whisper. "He is more powerful
than all the rest of us together. He lives in the City
of Emeralds."</p>

<p>Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just
then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by,
gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house
where the Wicked Witch had been lying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

   </div>

<p>"What is it?" asked the
little old woman; and
looked, and began to laugh.
The feet of the dead Witch
had disappeared entirely
and nothing was left but
the silver shoes.</p>

<p>"She was so old," explained
the Witch of the
North, "that she dried up
quickly in the sun. That
is the end of her. But the
silver shoes are yours, and you shall
have them to wear." She reached
down and picked up the shoes, and
after shaking the dust out of them
handed them to Dorothy.</p>

<p>"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver
shoes," said one of the Munchkins; "and there is some
charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew."</p>

</div><!-- i027 -->

<p>Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed
them on the table. Then she came out again to the
Munchkins and said,</p>

<p>"I am anxious to get back to my Aunt and Uncle,
for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help
me find my way?"</p>

<p>The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.</p>

<p>"At the East, not far from here," said one, "there is a
great desert, and none could live to cross it."</p>


<p>"It is the same at the South," said another, "for I have
been there and seen it. The South is the country of the
Quadlings."</p>

<p>"I am told," said the third man, "that it is the same at
the West. And that country, where the Winkies live, is
ruled by the wicked Witch of the West, who would make
you her slave if you passed her way."</p>

<p>"The North is my home," said the old lady, "and at
its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land
of Oz. I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live
with us."</p>

<p>Dorothy began to sob, at this, for she felt lonely
among all these strange people. Her tears seemed to
grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately
took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As
for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced
the point on the end of her nose, while she counted
"one, two, three" in a solemn voice. At once the
cap changed to a slate, on which was written in
big, white chalk marks:</p>

   </div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">let dorothy go to the city of emeralds.</span>"</p>

<p>The little old woman took the slate from her
nose, and, having read the words on it, asked,</p>

<p>"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?"</p>
</div><!-- i028 -->
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," answered the child, looking up and drying her
tears.</p>

<p>"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps
Oz will help you."</p>

<p>"Where is this City?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled
by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of."</p>

<p>"Is he a good man?" enquired the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not
I cannot tell, for I have never seen him."</p>

<p>"How can I get there?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a
country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark
and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I
know of to keep you from harm."</p>

<p>"Won't you go with me?" pleaded the girl, who had
begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

      <div class="right" style="width: 1px; height: 465px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"No, I cannot do that," she replied; "but I will give
you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has
been kissed by the Witch of the North."</p>


<p>She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on
the forehead. Where her lips touched the girl they left a
round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.</p>

<p>"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow
brick," said the Witch; "so you cannot miss it. When
you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story
and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear."</p>

<p>The three Munchkins
bowed low to her and wished
her a pleasant journey, after
which they walked away
through the trees. The
Witch gave Dorothy a
friendly little nod, whirled
around on her left heel
three times, and straightway
disappeared, much to
the surprise of little Toto,
who barked after her loudly
enough when she had gone,
because he had been afraid even to growl while she
stood by.</p>

<p>But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected
her to disappear in just that way, and was not
surprised in the least.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">When </span>Dorothy was
left alone she began
to feel hungry. So she went to the
cupboard and cut herself some
bread, which she spread with butter.
She gave some to Toto, and taking a
pail from the shelf she carried it down
to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.
Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds
sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such
delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered
some of it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her
breakfast.</p>

</div><!-- i033 -->

<p>Then she went back to the house, and having helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water,
she set about making ready for the journey to the City of
Emeralds.</p>

<p>Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened
to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It
was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although
the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was
still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully,
dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink
sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled
it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over
the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed
how old and worn her shoes were.</p>

<p>"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,"
she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little
black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she
meant.</p>

<p>At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the
silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the
East.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they will fit me," she said to Toto. "They
would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they
could not wear out."</p>

<p>She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the
silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been
made for her.</p>

<p>Finally she picked up her basket.</p>

   </div>


<p>"Come along, Toto," she said, "we will go to the
Emerald City and ask the great Oz how to get back to
Kansas again."</p>

<p>She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully
in the pocket of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting
along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.</p>

<p>There were several roads near by, but it did not take
her long to find the one paved with yellow brick. Within
a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald
City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow
roadbed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweet
and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might think
a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away
from her own country and set down in the midst of a
strange land.</p>

<p>She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how
pretty the country was about her. There were neat fences
at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and
beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance.
Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and
able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass
a house, and the people came out to look at
her and bow low as she went by; for everyone
knew she had been the means
of destroying the wicked
witch and setting them free
from bondage. The houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the Munchkins were odd looking dwellings, for each
was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted
blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite
color.</p>

</div><!-- i035 -->
<p>Towards evening, when Dorothy was tired with her
long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the
night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest.
On the green lawn before it many men and women were
dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible
and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table
near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and
cakes, and many other good things to eat.</p>

<p>The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her
to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was
the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and
his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom
from the bondage of the wicked witch.</p>

<p>Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by
the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq. Then
she sat down upon a settee and watched the people
dance.</p>

<p>When Boq saw her silver shoes he said,</p>

<p>"You must be a great sorceress."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the
wicked witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and
only witches and sorceresses wear white."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dress is blue and white checked," said Dorothy,
smoothing out the wrinkles in it.</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to wear that," said Boq. "Blue is
the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color;
so we know you are a friendly witch."</p>

<div class="wrap_area_right">

      <div class="right" style="width: 400px; height: 160px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the
people seemed to think her a witch, and she knew very well
she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the
chance of a cyclone into a strange land.</p>

<p>When she had tired watching the dancing,
Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a
room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were
made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly
in them till morning, with Toto curled up on
the blue rug beside her.</p>

<p>She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a
wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and
pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way
that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine
curiosity to all the people, for they had never
seen a dog before.</p>

<p>"How far is it to the Emerald City?" the
girl asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," answered Boq, gravely,
"for I have never been there.
It is better for people to keep
away from Oz, unless they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
have business with him. But it is a long way to the
Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The
country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass
through rough and dangerous places before you reach the
end of your journey."</p>

</div><!-- i039 -->

<p>This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only
the great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she
bravely resolved not to turn back.</p>

<p>She bade her friends good-bye, and again started
along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several
miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so
climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat
down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and
not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a
pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.</p>

<p>Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed
thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack
stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose and mouth painted on
it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had
belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on this head,
and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn
and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On
the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every
man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above
the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.</p>

   <p class="caption2">"<i>Dorothy gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer,
painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must
have been mistaken, at first, for none of the scarecrows in
Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head
to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the
fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole
and barked.</p>

<p>"Good day," said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky
voice.</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" asked the girl, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the Scarecrow; "how do you
do?"</p>

<p>"I'm pretty well, thank you," replied Dorothy, politely;
"how do you do?"</p>

<p>"I'm not feeling well," said the Scarecrow, with a smile,
"for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day
to scare away crows."</p>

<p>"Can't you get down?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will
please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to
you."</p>

<p>Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure
off the pole; for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite
light.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said the Scarecrow, when he
had been set down on the ground. "I feel like a new
man."</p>

<p>Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
hear a stuffed man speak, and to see him bow and walk
along beside her.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow, when he had
stretched himself and yawned, "and where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Where is the Emerald City?" he enquired; "and who
is Oz?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise.</p>

</div><!-- i044 -->

<p>"No, indeed; I don't know anything. You see, I am
stuffed, so I have no brains at all," he answered, sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Dorothy; "I'm awfully sorry
for you."</p>

<p>"Do you think," he asked,
"If I go to the Emerald City
with you, that the great Oz
would give me some
brains?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell,"
she returned; "but
you may come with
me, if you like. If
Oz will not give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
any brains you will be no worse off than you are now."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued,
confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and
body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt. If anyone
treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn't matter,
for I cant feel it. But I do not want people to call me a
fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of
with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?"</p>

<p>"I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who
was truly sorry for him. "If you will come with me I'll ask
Oz to do all he can for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered, gratefully.</p>

<p>They walked back to the road, Dorothy helped him
over the fence, and they started along the path of yellow
brick for the Emerald City.</p>

<p>Toto did not like this addition to the party, at first.
He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there
might be a nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled
in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Don't mind Toto," said Dorothy, to her new friend;
"he never bites."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid," replied the Scarecrow, "he can't
hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I
shall not mind it, for I can't get tired. I'll tell you a secret,"
he continued, as he walked along; "there is only one thing
in the world I am afraid of."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Dorothy; "the Munchkin farmer
who made you?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the Scarecrow; "it's a lighted match."</p>

<p><span class="firstword">After </span>a few hours
the road began to be
rough, and the walking
grew so difficult that the
Scarecrow often stumbled over the
yellow brick, which were here very
uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they
were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto
jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the
Scarecrow, having no brains he walked straight ahead, and
so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard
bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would
pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined
her in laughing merrily at his own mishap.</p>

</div><!-- i049 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as
they were farther back. There were fewer houses and
fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal
and lonesome the country became.</p>

<p>At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little
brook, and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some
bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he
refused.</p>

<p>"I am never hungry," he said; "and it is a lucky thing
I am not. For my mouth is only painted, and if I should
cut a hole in it so I could eat, the straw I am stuffed with
would come out, and that would spoil the shape of my
head."</p>

<p>Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only
nodded and went on eating her bread.</p>

<p>"Tell me something about yourself, and the country
you came from," said the Scarecrow, when she had finished
her dinner. So she told him all about Kansas, and how
gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried
her to this queer land of Oz. The Scarecrow listened carefully,
and said,</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why you should wish to leave
this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place
you call Kansas."</p>

   <p class="caption2">"<i>'I was only made yesterday,' said the Scarecrow.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"That is because you have no brains," answered the
girl. "No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we
people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There is no place
like home."</p>

<p>The Scarecrow sighed.</p>

<p>"Of course I cannot understand it," he said. "If your
heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably
all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would
have no people at all. It is fortunate for Kansas that you
have brains."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?"
asked the child.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and
answered,</p>

<p>"My life has been so short that I really know nothing
whatever. I was only made day before yesterday. What
happened in the world before that time is all unknown to
me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the
first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard
what was going on. There was another Munchkin with
him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying,</p>

<p>"'How do you like those ears?'</p>

<p>"'They aren't straight,' answered the other.</p>

<p>"'Never mind,' said the farmer; 'they are ears just the
same,' which was true enough.</p>

<p>"'Now I'll make the eyes,' said the farmer. So he
painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found
myself looking at him and at everything around me with a
great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That's a rather pretty eye,' remarked the Munchkin
who was watching the farmer; 'blue paint is just the color
for eyes.'</p>

<p>"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,' said the
farmer; and when the second eye was done I could see
much better than before. Then he made my nose and my
mouth; but I did not speak, because at that time I didn't
know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching
them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they
fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I
thought I was just as good a man as anyone.</p>

<p>"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said
the farmer; 'he looks just like a man.'</p>

<p>"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed
with him. The farmer carried me under his arm to the
cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found
me. He and his friend soon after walked away and left
me alone.</p>

<p>"I did not like to be deserted this way; so I tried to
walk after them, but my feet would not touch the ground,
and I was forced to stay on that pole. It was a lonely life
to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made
such a little while before. Many crows and other birds
flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew
away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased
me and made me feel that I was quite an important person.
By and by an old crow flew near me, and after looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
me carefully he perched upon my shoulder
and said,</p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

      <div class="left" style="width: 100%; height: 145px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool
me in this clumsy manner. Any crow of sense
could see that you are only stuffed with straw.'
Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all
the corn he wanted. The other birds, seeing
he was not harmed by me, came to eat the
corn too, so in a short time there was a great
flock of them about me."</p>

<p>"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not
such a good Scarecrow after all; but the old
crow comforted me, saying: 'If you only had
brains in your head you would be as good a
man as any of them, and a better man than
some of them. Brains are the only things
worth having in this world, no matter whether
one is a crow or a man.'</p>

<p>"After the crows had gone I thought this
over, and decided I would try hard to get some brains.
By good luck, you came along and pulled me off the stake,
and from what you say I am sure the great Oz will give
me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City."</p>

</div><!-- i055 -->

<p>"I hope so," said Dorothy, earnestly, "since you seem
anxious to have them."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I am anxious," returned the Scarecrow. "It
is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the girl, "let us go." And she handed the
basket to the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>There were no fences at all by the road side now, and
the land was rough and untilled. Towards evening they
came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and
close together that their branches met over the road of yellow
brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the
branches shut out the daylight; but the travellers did not
stop, and went on into the forest.</p>

<p>"If this road goes in, it must come out," said the Scarecrow,
"and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the
road, we must go wherever it leads us."</p>

<p>"Anyone would know that," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Certainly; that is why I know it," returned the Scarecrow.
"If it required brains to figure it out, I never should
have said it."</p>

<p>After an hour or so the light faded away, and they
found themselves stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy
could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see
very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could
see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm, and
managed to get along fairly well.</p>

<p>"If you see any house, or any place where we can pass
the night," she said, "you must tell me; for it is very
uncomfortable walking in the dark."</p>

<p>Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.</p>

<p>"I see a little cottage at the right of us," he said, "built
of logs and branches. Shall we go there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed;" answered the child. "I am all tired out."</p>

<p>So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they
reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed
of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at once, and
with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. The
Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner
and waited patiently until morning came.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">When </span>Dorothy awoke
the sun was shining
through the trees and
Toto had long been out chasing birds
and squirrels. She sat up and looked
around her. There was the Scarecrow,
still standing patiently in his
corner, waiting for her.</p>

<p>"We must go and search for water," she said to him.</p>

<p>"Why do you want water?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and
to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat."</p>

</div><!-- i061 -->

<p>"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the
Scarecrow, thoughtfully; "for you must sleep, and eat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
drink. However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of
bother to be able to think properly."</p>

<p>They left the cottage and walked through the trees
until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy
drank and bathed and ate her breakfast. She saw
there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl
was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything,
for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the
day.</p>

<p>When she had finished her meal, and was about to
go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to
hear a deep groan near by.</p>

<p>"What was that?" she asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," replied the Scarecrow; "but we
can go and see."</p>

<p>Just then another groan reached their ears, and the
sound seemed to come from behind them. They turned
and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy
discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that
fell between the trees. She ran to the place, and then
stopped short, with a cry of surprise.</p>

<p>One of the big trees had been partly chopped through,
and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands,
was a man made entirely of tin. His head and arms and
legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly
motionless, as if he could not stir at all.</p>

   </div>

<p>Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Scarecrow, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at
the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.</p>

<p>"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the tin man; "I did. I've been groaning
for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me
before or come to help me."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" she enquired, softly, for she
was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.</p>

<p>"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he
answered. "They are rusted so badly that
I cannot move them at all; if I am well
oiled I shall soon be all right again. You
will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."</p>

<p>Dorothy at once ran back to the
cottage and found the oil-can, and then she
returned and asked, anxiously,</p>

<p>"Where are your joints?"</p>

<p>"Oil my neck, first," replied
the Tin Woodman. So
she oiled it, and as it was quite
badly rusted the Scarecrow
took hold of the tin head and
moved it gently from side to
side until it worked freely,
and then the man could turn
it himself.</p>

</div><!-- i063 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said. And Dorothy
oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until
they were quite free from rust and as good as new.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and
lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree.</p>

<p>"This is a great comfort," he said. "I have been holding
that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to
be able to put it down at last. Now, if you will oil the
joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more."</p>

<p>So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely;
and he thanked them again and again for his release, for
he seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful.</p>

<p>"I might have stood there always if you had not come
along," he said; "so you have certainly saved my life.
How did you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"We are on our way to the Emerald City, to see the
great Oz," she answered, "and we stopped at your cottage
to pass the night."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to see Oz?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want him to send me back to Kansas; and the
Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head,"
she replied.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a
moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?"</p>

<p>"Why, I guess so," Dorothy answered; "it would be
as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"True," the Tin Woodman returned. "So, if you will
allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald
City and ask Oz to help me."</p>

<p>"Come along," said the Scarecrow, heartily; and
Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his
company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and
they all passed through the forest until they came to the
road that was paved with yellow brick.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can
in her basket. "For," he said, "if I should get caught in
the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly."</p>

<p>It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade
join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey
again they came to a place where the trees and branches
grew so thick over the road that the travellers could not
pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe
and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the
entire party.</p>

<p>Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked
along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled
into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road. Indeed,
he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you walk around the hole?" asked the
Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"I don't know enough," replied the Scarecrow, cheerfully.
"My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that
is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see;" said the Tin Woodman. "But, after all,
brains are not the best things in the world."</p>

<p>"Have you any?" enquired the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"No, my head is quite empty," answered the Woodman;
"but once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having
tried them both, I should much rather have a heart."</p>

<p>"And why is that?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"I will tell you my story, and then you will know."</p>

<p>So, while they were walking through the forest, the
Tin Woodman told the following story:</p>

<p>"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down
trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When
I grew up I too became a wood-chopper, and after my
father died I took care of my old mother as long as she
lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living
alone I would marry, so that I might not become
lonely.</p>

</div><!-- i068 -->

<p>"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so
beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart.
She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could
earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I
set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an
old woman who did not want
her to marry anyone, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do
the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went
to the wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two
sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.
Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when
I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious
to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible,
the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.</p>

<p>"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a
one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper.
So I went to a tin-smith and had him make me a new leg
out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to
it; but my action angered the wicked Witch of the East,
for she had promised the old woman I should not marry
the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again
my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to
the tinner, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After
this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the
other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin
ones. The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut
off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me.
But the tinner happened to come along, and he made me
a new head out of tin.</p>

<p>"I thought I had beaten the wicked Witch then, and I
worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my
enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my
love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe
slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting
me into two halves. Once more the tinner came to my
help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms
and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could
move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart,
so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did
not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is
still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come
after her.</p>

<p>"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very
proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for
it could not cut me. There was only one danger&mdash;that my
joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and
took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,
there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being
caught in a rainstorm, before I
thought of the danger my joints had
rusted, and I was left to stand in
the woods until you came to help
me. It was a terrible thing to undergo,
but during the year I stood
there I had time to think that the
greatest loss I had known was the
loss of my heart. While I
was in love I was the happiest
man on earth; but no
one can love who has not a
heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me
one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin
maiden and marry her."</p>

<p>Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been
greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and
now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.</p>

<p>"All the same," said the Scarecrow, "I shall ask for
brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what
to do with a heart if he had one."</p>

<p>"I shall take the heart," returned the Tin Woodman;
"for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the
best thing in the world."</p>

<p>Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to
know which of her two friends was right, and she decided
if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt
Em it did not matter so much whether the
Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow
no heart, or each got what he wanted.</p>

<p>What worried her most was that the
bread was nearly gone, and another
meal for herself and Toto
would empty the basket. To be
sure neither the Woodman nor
the Scarecrow ever ate anything,
but she was not made of tin nor
straw, and could not live unless
she was fed.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">All </span>this time Dorothy
and her companions had been
walking through the thick
woods. The road was still
paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by
dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the
walking was not at all good.</p>

<p>There were few birds in this part of the forest, for
birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine;
but now and then there came a deep growl from
some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds
made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know
what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to
Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return.</p>

</div><!-- i076 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long will it be," the child asked of the Tin
Woodman, "before we are out of the forest?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never
been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once,
when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey
through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city
where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not
afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt
the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the
mark of the good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you
from harm."</p>

<p>"But Toto!" said the girl, anxiously; "what will protect
him?"</p>

<p>"We must protect him ourselves, if he is in danger,"
replied the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible
roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into
the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow
spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and
then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.
But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression
on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road
and lay still.</p>

<p>Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran
barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto
would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward
and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could,
while she cried out:</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor
little dog!"</p>

<p>"I didn't bite him," said the Lion, as he rubbed his
nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.</p>

<p>"No, but you tried to," she retorted. "You are nothing
but a big coward."</p>

<p>"I know it," said the Lion, hanging his head in shame;
"I've always known it. But how can I help it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a
stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!"</p>

<p>"Is he stuffed?" asked the Lion, in surprise, as he
watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his
feet, while she patted him into shape again.</p>

<p>"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was
still angry.</p>

<p>"That's why he went over so easily," remarked the
Lion. "It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is
the other one stuffed, also?"</p>

<p>"No," said Dorothy, "he's made of tin." And she
helped the Woodman up again.</p>

<p>"That's why he nearly blunted my claws," said the
Lion. "When they scratched against the tin it made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal
you are so tender of?"</p>

   </div>

<p>"He is my dog, Toto," answered Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?" asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Neither. He's a&mdash;a&mdash;a meat dog," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh. He's a curious animal, and seems remarkably
small, now that I look at him. No one would think of
biting such a little thing except a coward like me," continued
the Lion, sadly.</p>

<p>"What makes you a coward?" asked Dorothy, looking
at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a
small horse.</p>

<p>"It's a mystery," replied the Lion. "I
suppose I was born that way. All the other
animals in the forest naturally expect me to
be brave, for the Lion is everywhere
thought to be the King of
Beasts. I learned that if I roared
very loudly every living thing was
frightened and got out of my way.
Whenever I've met a man I've been
awfully scared; but I just roared at
him, and he has always run away
as fast as he could go. If the elephants
and the tigers and the bears
had ever tried to fight me, I should
have run myself&mdash;I'm such a
coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try
to get away from me, and of course I let them go."</p>

</div><!-- i079 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't
be a coward," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"I know it," returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his
eye with the tip of his tail; "it is my great sorrow, and
makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger
my heart begins to beat fast."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have heart disease," said the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"It may be," said the Lion.</p>

<p>"If you have," continued the Tin Woodman, "you
ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For
my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart
disease."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Lion, thoughtfully, "if I had no
heart I should not be a coward."</p>

<p>"Have you brains?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I've never looked to see," replied the
Lion.</p>

<p>"I am going to the great Oz to ask him to give me
some," remarked the Scarecrow, "for my head is stuffed
with straw."</p>

<p>"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart," said
the Woodman.</p>

<p>"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me
back to Kansas," added Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think Oz could give me courage?" asked the
cowardly Lion.</p>

<p>"Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the
Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Or give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"Or send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you," said the
Lion, "for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of
courage."</p>

<p>"You will be very welcome," answered Dorothy, "for
you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems
to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they
allow you to scare them so easily."</p>

<p>"They really are," said the Lion; "but that doesn't
make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be
a coward I shall be unhappy."</p>

<p>So once more the little company set off upon the
journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's
side. Toto did not approve this new comrade at first, for
he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between
the Lion's great jaws; but after a time he became
more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion
had grown to be good friends.</p>

<p>During the rest of that day there was no other adventure
to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the
Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling
along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made
the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful
not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he
wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran
slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and
there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a
question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for
his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly
frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to
relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was
also puzzled to know what was wrong.
But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can
from Dorothy's basket and oiled the
Woodman's jaws, so that after a few
moments he could talk as well as
before.</p>

<p>"This will serve me a lesson,"
said he, "to look where I
step. For if I should kill another
bug or beetle I should
surely cry
again, and
crying rusts
my jaw so
that I cannot
speak."</p>

</div><!-- i082 -->

<p>Thereafter
he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw
a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to
harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no
heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel
or unkind to anything.</p>

<p>"You people with hearts," he said, "have something to
guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no
heart, and so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me
a heart of course I needn't mind so much."</p>

<p><span class="firstword">They </span>were obliged
to camp out that
night under a
large tree in the
forest, for there were no houses
near. The tree made a good,
thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin
Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and
Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made
her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of their
bread, and now she did not know what they would do for
breakfast.</p>

<p>"If you wish," said the Lion, "I will go into the forest
and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since
your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food,
and then you will have a very good breakfast."</p>

<p>"Don't! please don't," begged the Tin Woodman.
"I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and
then my jaws would rust again."</p>

<p>But the Lion went away into the forest and found
his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he
didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow found a tree full
of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so that she
would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this
was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she
laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor
creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so
clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost
as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did
not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it
enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he
feared a spark might get into his straw and
burn him up. So he kept a good distance
away from the flames, and
only came near to cover
Dorothy with dry
leaves when she
lay down to
sleep. These
kept her very
snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning.</p>

<p>When it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a
little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward
the Emerald City.</p>

</div><!-- i087 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>This was to be an eventful day for the travellers.
They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw
before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided
the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a
very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and
looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and
there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The
sides were so steep that none of them could climb down,
and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Dorothy, despairingly.</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," said the Tin Woodman;
and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.
But the Scarecrow said:</p>

<p>"We cannot fly, that is certain; neither can we climb
down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump
over it, we must stop where we are."</p>

<p>"I think I could jump over it," said the Cowardly Lion,
after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.</p>

<p>"Then we are all right," answered the Scarecrow, "for
you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try it," said the Lion. "Who will go first?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

   </div>

<p>"I will," declared the Scarecrow; "for, if you found
that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be
killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the
rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not
matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all."</p>

<p>"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself," said
the Cowardly Lion, "but I suppose there is nothing
to do but try it. So get on my back and we will
make the attempt."</p>

<p>The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and
the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and
crouched down.</p>

<p>"Why don't you run and jump?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things,"
he replied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through
the air and landed safely on the other side. They were
all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the
Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang
across the ditch again.</p>

<p>Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto
in her arms and climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly
to his mane with one hand. The next moment it seemed
as if she was flying through the air; and then, before she
had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side.
The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman,
and then they all sat down for a few moments to give
the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his
breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been
running too long.</p>

</div><!-- i089 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>They found the
forest very thick on
this side, and it looked
dark and gloomy.
After the Lion had rested they
started along the road of yellow
brick, silently wondering, each in
his own mind, if ever they would
come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine
again. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard
strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion
whispered to them that it was in this part of the country
that the Kalidahs lived.</p>

<p>"What are the Kalidahs?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and
heads like tigers," replied the Lion; "and with claws
so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as
easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly afraid of the
Kalidahs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not surprised that you are," returned Dorothy
"They must be dreadful beasts."</p>

<p>The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they
came to another gulf across the road; but this one was so
broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not
leap across it.</p>

<p>So they sat down to consider what they should do,
and after serious thought the Scarecrow said,</p>

<p>"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If
the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to
the other side, we can walk across it easily."</p>

<p>"That is a first rate idea," said the Lion. "One would
almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of
straw."</p>

<p>The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was
his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through.
Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree
and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree
tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top
branches on the other side.</p>

<p>They had just started to cross this queer bridge when
a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror
they saw running toward them two great beasts with
bodies like bears and heads like tigers.</p>

<p>"They are the Kalidahs!" said the Cowardly Lion,
beginning to tremble.</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried the Scarecrow, "let us cross over."</p>

<p>So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms; the
Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next.
The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face
the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar
that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backwards,
while even the fierce beasts stopped short and
looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering
that there were two of them and only one of
him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion
crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would
do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts
also began to cross the tree, and the Lion said to Dorothy,</p>

<p>"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces
with their sharp claws. But stand close behind me, and
I will fight them as long as I am alive."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" called the Scarecrow. He had
been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked
the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested
on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to
use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were
nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying
the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were
dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath
of relief, "I see we are going to live a little while longer,
and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
thing not to be alive.
Those creatures frightened
me so badly that
my heart is beating
yet."</p>

      <div class="left" style="width: 1px; height: 435px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"Ah." said the Tin
Woodman, sadly, "I wish
I had a heart to beat."</p>

<p>This adventure made
the travellers more anxious
than ever to get out of the
forest, and they walked so fast
that Dorothy became tired, and
had to ride on the Lion's back.
To their great joy the trees became thinner the further
they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came
upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On
the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow
brick running through a beautiful country, with green
meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered
with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They were
greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.</p>

<p>"How shall we cross the river?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"That is easily done," replied the Scarecrow. "The
Tin Woodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the
other side."</p>

<p>So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop
down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at
this the Scarecrow found on the river bank a tree full of
fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but
nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.</p>

</div><!-- i095 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as
industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when
night came the work was not done. So they found a cozy
place under the trees where they slept well until the morning;
and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of
the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to
her own home again.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Our </span>little party
of travellers awakened
next morning
refreshed and full of hope, and
Dorothy breakfasted like a
princess off peaches and plums
from the trees beside the river.</p>

<p>Behind them was the dark forest
they had passed safely through, although
they had suffered many discouragements;
but before them was a lovely,
sunny country that seemed to beckon
them on to the Emerald City.</p>

<p>To be sure, the broad river now
cut them off from this beautiful land; but the raft was
nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few
more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins,
they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle
of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly
Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he
was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman
stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had
long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.</p>

</div><!-- i100 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>They got along quite well at first, but when they
reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the
raft down stream, farther and farther away from the road
of yellow brick; and the water grew so deep that the long
poles would not touch the bottom.</p>

<p>"This is bad," said the Tin Woodman, "for if
we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the
country of the wicked Witch of the West, and she will
enchant us and make us her slaves."</p>

      <div class="left" style="width: 100%; height: 135px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"And then I should get no brains," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"And I should get no
courage," said the Cowardly
Lion.</p>

<p>"And I should get
no heart," said the Tin
Woodman.</p>

</div><!-- i101 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I should never get back to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,"
the Scarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long
pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river,
and before he could pull it out again, or let go, the raft
was swept away and the poor Scarecrow left clinging to
the pole in the middle of the river.</p>

<p>"Good bye!" he called after them, and they were very
sorry to leave him; indeed, the Tin Woodman began to
cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and
so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.</p>

<p>Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.</p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

   <img src="images/i102_edit.jpg" alt="Scarecrow on pole" title="Scarecrow on pole" height="425" width="600" />

   <div class="shape_wrap_left">
      <div class="right" style="width: 290px; height: 425px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,"
he thought. "Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield,
where I could make believe scare
the crows, at any rate; but surely
there is no use for a Scarecrow
stuck on a pole in the middle of a
river. I am afraid I shall never
have any brains, after all!"</p>

<p>Down the stream the raft
floated, and the poor Scarecrow
was left far behind. Then the
Lion said:</p>

</div><!-- i102 -->

<p>"Something must be done to
save us. I think I can swim to
the shore and pull the raft after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
me, if you will only hold fast to the tip
of my tail."</p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

   <img src="images/i103_edit.jpg" alt="Scarecrow on pole" title="Scarecrow on pole" height="840" width="600" />

   <div class="shape_wrap_left">
      <div class="left" style="width: 235px; height: 195px">&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="left" style="width: 150px; height: 645px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>So he sprang into the water and
the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of
his tail, when the Lion began to swim
with all his might toward the shore. It
was hard work, although he was so big;
but by and by they were drawn out of the current,
and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's long
pole and helped push the raft to the land.</p>

<p>They were all tired out when they reached the
shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green
grass, and they also knew that the stream had
carried them a long way past the road of yellow
brick that led to the Emerald City.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" asked the Tin
Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to
let the sun dry him.</p>

<p>"We must get back to the road, in some way,"
said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"The best plan will be to walk along the river
bank until we come to the road again," remarked
the Lion.</p>

<p>So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked
up her basket and they started along the grassy
bank, back to the road from which the river had
carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty
of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and
had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow they
could have been very happy.</p>

</div><!-- i103 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy
only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a
time the Tin Woodman cried out,</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow
perched upon his pole in the middle of the water,
looking very lonely and sad.</p>

<p>"What can we do to save him?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads,
for they did not know. So they sat down upon the bank
and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by,
which, seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and where are you going?" asked the
Stork.</p>

<p>"I am Dorothy," answered the girl; "and these are my
friends, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and
we are going to the Emerald City."</p>

<p>"This isn't the road," said the Stork, as she twisted her
long neck and looked sharply at the queer party.</p>

<p>"I know it," returned Dorothy, "but we have lost the
Scarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked the Stork.</p>

<p>"Over there in the river," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for
you," remarked the Stork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"He isn't heavy a bit," said Dorothy, eagerly, "for he
is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us
we shall thank you ever and ever so much."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try," said the Stork; "but if I find he is too
heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again."</p>

<p>So the big bird flew into the air and over the water
till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon
his pole. Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the
Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and
back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin
Woodman and Toto were sitting.</p>

<p>When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends
again he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the
Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he sang "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!"
at every step, he felt so gay.</p>

<p>"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,"
he said, "but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever
get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do it some
kindness in return."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the Stork, who was flying along
beside them. "I always like to help anyone in trouble.
But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest
for me. I hope you will find the Emerald City and that
Oz will help you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Dorothy, and then the kind
Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight.</p>

   <p class="caption2">"<i>The Stork carried him up into the air.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>They walked along listening to the singing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>bright-colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers
which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted
with them. There were big yellow and white and blue
and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,
which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled
Dorothy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl asked, as she breathed
in the spicy scent of the flowers.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," answered the Scarecrow. "When I
have brains I shall probably like them better."</p>

<p>"If I only had a heart I should love them," added the
Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"I always did like flowers," said the Lion; "they seem
so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so
bright as these."</p>

<p>They now came upon more and more of the big
scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers;
and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great
meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when
there are many of these flowers together their odor is so
powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if
the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers
he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not
know this, nor could she get away from the bright red
flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes
grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.</p>

<p>"We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow
brick before dark," he said; and the Scarecrow agreed
with him. So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand
no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot
where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked the Tin Woodman.</p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

   <img src="images/i109-edit.jpg" alt="The group in the poppy field" title="The group in the poppy field" height="443" width="600" />

      <div class="left" style="width: 100%; height: 290px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"If we leave her here she will die," said the
Lion. "The smell of the flowers is killing us
all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open
and the dog is asleep already."</p>

<p>It was true; Toto had fallen down beside
his little mistress. But the Scarecrow and the
Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were
not troubled by the scent of the flowers.</p>

</div><!-- i109 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Run fast," said the Scarecrow to the Lion, "and get
out of this deadly flower-bed as soon as you can. We will
bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep
you are too big to be carried."</p>

<p>So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as
fast as he could go. In a moment he was out of sight.</p>

<p>"Let us make a chair with our hands, and carry her,"
said the Scarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the
dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they made a chair with
their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and
carried the sleeping girl between them through
the flowers.</p>

<p>On and on they walked, and it seemed that
the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded
them would never end. They followed the bend
of the river, and at last came upon their friend
the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies.
The flowers had been too strong for the huge
beast and he had given up, at last, and fallen
only a short distance from the end of the poppy-bed,
where the sweet grass spread in beautiful
green fields before them.</p>

<p>"We can do nothing for him," said the Tin
Woodman, sadly; "for he is much too heavy to
lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever,
and perhaps he will dream that he has
found courage at last."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the Scarecrow; "the Lion was a very
good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on."</p>

<p>They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside
the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her
breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here
they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the
fresh breeze to waken her.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">We </span>cannot be far
from the road of yellow
brick, now," remarked the
Scarecrow, as he stood beside the
girl, "for we have come nearly as
far as the river carried us away."</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman was about
to reply when he heard a low growl,
and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges)
he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass
towards them. It was, indeed, a great, yellow wildcat, and
the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for
its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide
open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes
glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin
Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little
gray field-mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it
was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless
creature.</p>

</div><!-- i114 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the wildcat
ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast's head
clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two
pieces.</p>

<p>The field-mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy,
stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it
said, in a squeaky little voice,</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving
my life."</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it, I beg of you," replied the Woodman.
"I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help
all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be
only a mouse."</p>

<p>"Only a mouse!" cried the little animal, indignantly;
"why, I am a Queen&mdash;the Queen of all the field-mice!"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed," said the Woodman, making a bow.</p>

<p>"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a
brave one, in saving my life," added the Queen.</p>

<p>At that moment several mice were seen running up
as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they
saw their Queen they exclaimed,</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i116" id="i116"></a>
   <img src="images/i116_edit.jpg" alt="Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen." title="Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen." />
   <p class="caption2">"<i>Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed!
How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?" and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>they all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost
stood upon their heads.</p>

<p>"This funny tin man," she answered, "killed the Wildcat
and saved my life. So hereafter you must all serve
him, and obey his slightest wish."</p>

<p>"We will!" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And
then they scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened
from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him
he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle
of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice
when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.</p>

<p>But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms
and held him tight, while he called to the mice: "Come
back! come back! Toto shall not hurt you."</p>

   </div>

<p>At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out
from a clump of grass and asked, in
a timid voice,</p>

<p>"Are you sure he will not bite us?"</p>

<p>"I will not let him," said the
Woodman; "so do not be afraid."</p>

<p>One by one the mice came creeping
back, and Toto did not bark again,
although he tried to get out of
the Woodman's arms, and would
have bitten him had he not known
very well he was made of tin. Finally
one of the biggest mice spoke.</p>

<p>"Is there anything we can do," it asked, "to repay you
for saving the life of our Queen?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know of," answered the Woodman;
but the Scarecrow, who had been trying to think, but could
not because his head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly,</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion,
who is asleep in the poppy bed."</p>

<p>"A Lion!" cried the little Queen; "why, he would eat
us all up."</p>

<p>"Oh, no;" declared the Scarecrow; "this Lion is a
coward."</p>

<p>"Really?" asked the Mouse.</p>

<p>"He says so himself," answered the Scarecrow, "and
he would never hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will
help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all
with kindness."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Queen, "we will trust you. But
what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Are there many of these mice which call you Queen
and are willing to obey you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there are thousands," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible,
and let each one bring a long piece of string."</p>

<p>The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and
told them to go at once and get all her people. As soon
as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction
as fast as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman,
"you must go to those trees by the river-side and make a
truck that will carry the Lion."</p>

<p>So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began
to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of
trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and
branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and
made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree-trunk.
So fast and so well did he work that by the time
the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.</p>

<p>They came from all directions, and there were thousands
of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized
mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth.
It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long
sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to
find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice
standing around and looking at her timidly. But the
Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the
dignified little Mouse, he said,</p>

<p>"Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the
Queen."</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a
courtesy, after which she became quite friendly with the
little girl.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to
fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had
brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course
the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the
mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been
harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were
drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place
where the Lion lay asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

      <div class="left" style="width: 100%; height: 240px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was
heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck. Then
the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for
she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long
they also would fall asleep.</p>

<p>At first the little creatures, many though they were,
could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman
and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and
they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of
the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe
the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of
the flowers.</p>

</div><!-- i121 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little
mice warmly for saving her companion from death. She
had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had
been rescued.</p>

<p>Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and
scampered away through the grass to their homes. The
Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.</p>

<p>"If ever you need us again," she said, "come out into
the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your
assistance. Good bye!"</p>

<p>"Good bye!" they all answered, and away the Queen
ran, while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after
her and frighten her.</p>

<p>After this they sat down beside the Lion until he
should awaken; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some
fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">It </span>was some time before the
Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain
among the poppies a long while, breathing
in their deadly fragrance; but when
he did open his eyes and roll off the
truck he was very glad to find himself still
alive.</p>

<p>"I ran as fast as I could," he said, sitting down and
yawning; "but the flowers were too strong for me. How
did you get me out?"</p>

<p>Then they told him of the field-mice, and how they
had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly
Lion laughed, and said,</p>

<p>"I have always thought myself very big and terrible;
yet such small things as flowers came near to killing me,
and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How
strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?"</p>

<p>"We must journey on until we find the road of yellow
brick again," said Dorothy; "and then we can keep on to
the Emerald City."</p>

<p>So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite
himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly
enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was
not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and
turned again toward the Emerald City where the great
Oz dwelt.</p>

</div><!-- i127 -->

<p>The road was smooth and well
paved, now, and the country about
was beautiful; so that the travelers
rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind,
and with it the many dangers
they had met in its gloomy shades.
Once more they could see fences built beside the road;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
but these were painted green, and when they came to a
small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also
was painted green. They passed by several of these houses
during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the
doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask
questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them
because of the great Lion, of which they were much afraid.
The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald
green color and wore peaked hats like those of the
Munchkins.</p>

<p>"This must be the Land of Oz," said Dorothy, "and
we are surely getting near the Emerald City."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Scarecrow; "everything is green
here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the
favorite color. But the people do
not seem to be as friendly as the
Munchkins and I'm afraid we shall
be unable to find a place to pass the
night."</p>

<p>"I should like something to eat
besides fruit," said the girl, "and
I'm sure Toto is nearly starved.
Let us stop at the next house and
talk to the people."</p>

<p>So, when they came to a good
sized farm house, Dorothy walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
boldly up to the door and knocked. A woman opened it
just far enough to look out, and said,</p>

<p>"What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion
with you?"</p>

<p>"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow
us," answered Dorothy; "and the Lion is my friend and
comrade, and would not hurt you for the world."</p>

<p>"Is he tame?" asked the woman, opening the door a
little wider.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes;" said the girl, "and he is a great coward,
too; so that he will be more afraid of you than you are
of him."</p>

<p>"Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and
taking another peep at the Lion, "if that is the case you
may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place
to sleep."</p>

<p>So they all entered the house, where there were, besides
the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his
leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed
greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while
the woman was busy laying the table the man asked,</p>

<p>"Where are you all going?"</p>

<p>"To the Emerald City," said Dorothy, "to see the
Great Oz."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed the man. "Are you sure
that Oz will see you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" she replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it is said that he never lets any one come into
his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many
times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have
never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know
of any living person who has seen him."</p>

      <div class="right" style="width: 345px; height: 300px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"Does he never go out?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Never. He sits day after day in the great throne
room of his palace, and even those who wait upon him do
not see him face to face."</p>

<p>"What is he like?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"That is hard to tell," said the man, thoughtfully.
"You see, Oz is a great Wizard, and can take on any form
he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and
some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks
like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a
brownie, or in any other form that
pleases him. But who the real Oz is,
when he is in his own form, no living
person can tell."</p>

<p>"That is very strange," said Dorothy;
"but we must try, in
some way, to see him, or we
shall have made our journey
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to
see the terrible Oz?" asked
the man.</p>

</div><!-- i130 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want him to give me some brains," said the Scarecrow,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough," declared the
man. "He has more brains than he needs."</p>

<p>"And I want him to give me a heart," said the Tin
Woodman.</p>

<p>"That will not trouble him," continued the man, "for
Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes."</p>

<p>"And I want him to give me courage," said the Cowardly
Lion.</p>

<p>"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room,"
said the man, "which he has covered with a golden plate,
to keep it from running over. He will be glad to give you
some."</p>

<p>"And I want him to send me back to Kansas," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Where is Kansas?" asked the man, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Dorothy, sorrowfully; "but it
is my home, and I'm sure it's somewhere."</p>

<p>"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose
he will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see
him, and that will be a hard task; for the great Wizard
does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own
way. But what do you want?" he continued, speaking to
Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he
could not speak.</p>

   <p class="caption2">"<i>The Lion ate some of the porridge.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>The woman now called to them that supper was ready,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some
delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a
plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion
ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it
was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for
lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing
at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get
a good supper again.</p>

<p>The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and
Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion guarded the door
of her room so she might not be disturbed. The Scarecrow
and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept
quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they
started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow
in the sky just before them.</p>

<p>"That must be the Emerald City," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>As they walked on, the green glow became brighter
and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing
the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon before they
came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was
high, and thick, and of a bright green color.</p>

<p>In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow
brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered
so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow
were dazzled by their brilliancy.</p>

<p>There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then
the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed
through and found themselves in a high arched room, the
walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.</p>

<p>Before them stood a little man about the same size
as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his
head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint.
At his side was a large green box.</p>

<p>When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man
asked,</p>

<p>"What do you wish in the Emerald City?"</p>

<p>"We came here to see the Great Oz," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat
down to think it over.</p>

<p>"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see
Oz," he said, shaking his head in perplexity. "He is powerful
and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish
errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard,
he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant."</p>

   </div>

<p>"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied
the Scarecrow; "it is important. And we have been
told that Oz is a good Wizard."</p>

<p>"So he is," said the green man; "and he rules the
Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not
honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most
terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. I
am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to
see the Great Oz I must take you to his palace. But first
you must put on the spectacles."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness
and glory of the Emerald City would blind you. Even
those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and
day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when
the City was first built, and I have the only key that will
unlock them."</p>

<p>He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was
filled with spectacles of every size
and shape. All of them had green
glasses in them. The Guardian
of the gates found a pair that
would just fit Dorothy and put
them over her eyes. There were
two golden bands fastened to them that passed around
the back of her head, where they were locked together by
a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of
the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on,
Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of
course she did not want to be blinded by the glare of the
Emerald City, so she said nothing.</p>

</div><!-- i136 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow
and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on
little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.</p>

<p>Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own
glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the
palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall
he opened another gate, and they all followed him through
the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Even </span>with eyes
protected by the
green spectacles
Dorothy and her friends were at
first dazzled by the brilliancy of
the wonderful City. The streets
were lined with beautiful houses
all built of green marble and studded everywhere with
sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the
same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together
were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in
the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of
green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint,
and the rays of the sun were green.</p>

<p>There were many people, men, women and children,
walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes
and had greenish skins. They looked at Dorothy and her
strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the
children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when
they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many
shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything
in them was green. Green candy and green pop-corn were
offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats and
green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling
green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy
could see that they paid for it with green pennies.</p>

</div><!-- i140 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any
kind; the men carried things around in little green carts,
which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed happy
and contented and prosperous.</p>

<p>The Guardian of the Gates led them through the
streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the
middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the Great
Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in
a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.</p>

<p>"Here are strangers," said the Guardian of the Gates
to him, "and they demand to see the Great Oz."</p>

<p>"Step inside," answered the soldier, "and I will carry
your message to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

   </div>

<p>So they passed through the Palace gates and were
led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green
furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made them all
wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering
this room, and when they were seated he said,
politely,</p>

<p>"Please make yourselves comfortable while I
go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz
you are here."</p>

<p>They had to wait a long time before the soldier
returned. When, at last, he came back,
Dorothy asked,</p>

<p>"Have you seen Oz?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no;" returned the soldier; "I
have never seen him. But I spoke to
him as he sat behind his screen, and
gave him your message. He says he
will grant you an audience, if you so desire;
but each one of you must enter his
presence alone, and he will admit but
one each day. Therefore, as you must
remain in the Palace for several days, I
will have you shown to rooms where
you may rest in comfort after your
journey."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the girl; "that
is very kind of Oz."</p>

<p>The soldier now blew upon a green
whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed
in a pretty green silk gown, entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
room. She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she
bowed low before Dorothy as she said,</p>

<p>"Follow me and I will show you your room."</p>

<p>So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except
Toto, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green
girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs
until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It
was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft, comfortable
bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet
counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle
of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the
air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble
basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and
there was a shelf with a row of little green books. When
Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full
of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so
funny.</p>

<p>In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk
and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy
exactly.</p>

<p>"Make yourself perfectly at home," said the green girl,
"and if you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send
for you to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others.
These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found
himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of
course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for
when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly
in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.
It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close
his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider
which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as
if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the
world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from
force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of
flesh; but not being able to sleep he passed the night
moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in
good working order. The Lion would have preferred a
bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being
shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this
worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself
up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden
came to fetch Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the
prettiest gowns&mdash;made of green brocaded satin. Dorothy
put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon
around Toto's neck, and they started for the
Throne Room of the Great Oz.</p>

<p>First they came to a great hall in which
were many ladies and gentlemen of the court,
all dressed in rich costumes.
These people had nothing
to do but talk to each other,
but they always came to
wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although
they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered
they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered,</p>

<p>"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the
Terrible?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the girl, "if he will see me."</p>

<p>"Oh, he will see you," said the soldier who had taken
her message to the Wizard, "although he does not like to
have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry,
and said I should send you back where you came from.
Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned
your silver shoes he was very much interested. At
last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he
decided he would admit you to his presence."</p>

</div><!-- i144 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to
Dorothy,</p>

<p>"That is the signal. You must go into the Throne
Room alone."</p>

<p>She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly
through and found herself in a wonderful place. It was a
big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and
ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set
closely together. In the center of the roof was a great
light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds
sparkle in a wonderful manner.</p>

<p>But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne
of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did
everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous
Head, without body to support it or any arms or legs
whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had
eyes and nose and mouth, and was bigger than the head
of the biggest giant.</p>

<p>As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the
eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily.
Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and
why do you seek me?"</p>

<p>It was not such an awful voice as she had expected
to come from the big Head; so she took courage and
answered,</p>

<p>"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to
you for help."</p>

<p>The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute.
Then said the voice:</p>

<p>"Where did you get the silver shoes?"</p>

<p>"I got them from the wicked Witch of the East, when
my house fell on her and killed her," she replied.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?"
continued the voice.</p>

<p>"That is where the good Witch of the North kissed
me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you," said
the girl.</p>

<p>Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw
she was telling the truth. Then Oz asked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and
Uncle Henry are," she answered, earnestly. "I don't like
your country, although it is so beautiful. And I am sure
Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away
so long."</p>

<p>The eyes winked three times, and then they turned
up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around
so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room.
And at last they looked at Dorothy again.</p>

<p>"Why should I do this for you?" asked Oz.</p>

<p>"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you
are a Great Wizard and I am only a helpless little girl,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"But you were strong enough to kill the wicked
Witch of the East," said Oz.</p>

<p>"That just happened," returned Dorothy, simply; "I
could not help it."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Head, "I will give you my answer.
You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas
unless you do something for me in return. In this
country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If
you wish me to use my magic power to send you home
again you must do something for me first. Help me and
I will help you."</p>

<p>"What must I do?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Kill the wicked Witch of the West," answered Oz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I cannot!" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the
silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm. There is now
but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you
can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas&mdash;but
not before."</p>

<p>The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed;
and the eyes winked again and looked upon her
anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him
if she would.</p>

<p>"I never killed anything, willingly," she sobbed; "and
even if I wanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch?
If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself,
how do you expect me to do it?"</p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

      <div class="right" style="width: 455px; height: 270px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"I do not know," said the Head; "but
that is my answer, and until the Wicked
Witch dies you will not see your Uncle
and Aunt again. Remember that the
Witch is Wicked&mdash;tremendously Wicked&mdash;and
ought to be killed. Now go, and
do not ask to see me again until you
have done your
task."</p>

<p>Sorrowfully
Dorothy left the
Throne Room
and went back
where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman
were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her.</p>

</div><!-- i148 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no hope for me," she said, sadly, "for Oz will
not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch
of the West; and that I can never do."</p>

<p>Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help
her; so she went to her own room and lay down on the bed
and cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers
came to the Scarecrow and said,</p>

<p>"Come with me, for Oz has sent for you."</p>

<p>So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted
into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the
emerald throne, a most lovely lady. She was dressed
in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks
a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were
wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if
the slightest breath of air reached them.</p>

<p>When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his
straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature,
she looked upon him sweetly, and said,</p>

<p>"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and
why do you seek me?"</p>

<p>Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the
great Head Dorothy had told him of, was much astonished;
but he answered her bravely.</p>

<p>"I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you
will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may
become as much a man as any other in your dominions."</p>

<div class="wrap_area_right">

   <img src="images/i150_edit.jpg" alt="Oz as a lady" title="Oz as a lady" height="672" width="400" />

      <div class="right" style="width: 400px; height: 205px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"Why should I do this for you?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else
can help me," answered the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"I never grant favors without some return," said Oz;
"but this much I will promise. If you will kill for me the
Wicked Witch of the West I will bestow upon you a
great many brains, and such good brains that you will be
the wisest man in all the Land of Oz."</p>

<p>"I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch," said,
the Scarecrow, in surprise.</p>

<p>"So I did. I don't care who kills her. But
until she is dead I will not grant your wish. Now
go, and do not seek me again until you have
earned the brains you so greatly desire."</p>

</div><!-- i150 -->

<p>The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his
friends and told them what Oz had said;
and Dorothy was surprised to find that
the great Wizard was not a Head, as she
had seen him, but a lovely lady.</p>

<p>"All the same," said the Scarecrow,
"she needs a heart as much as
the Tin Woodman."</p>

<p>On the next morning the soldier
with the green whiskers came
to the Tin Woodman and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oz has sent for you. Follow me,"</p>

<p>So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the
great Throne Room. He did not know whether he
would find Oz a lovely lady or a Head, but he hoped it
would be the lovely lady. "For," he said to himself,
"if it is the Head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart,
since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot
feel for me. But if it is the lovely lady I shall beg hard
for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly
hearted."</p>

<p>But when the Woodman entered the great Throne
Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had
taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as
big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly
strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head
like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its
face. There were five long arms growing out of its body
and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair
covered every part of it, and a more dreadful looking
monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin
Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have
beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the
Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much
disappointed.</p>

<p>"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible," spake the Beast, in
a voice that was one great roar. "Who are you, and why
do you seek me?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I
have no heart, and cannot love. I pray you to give me
a heart that I may be as other men are."</p>

<p>"Why should I do this?" demanded the Beast.</p>

<p>"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,"
answered the Woodman.</p>

<p>Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly,</p>

<p>"If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the Woodman.</p>


<p>"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,"
replied the Beast. "When the Witch is dead, come to me,
and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most
loving heart in all the Land of Oz."</p>

<div class="wrap_area_right">

      <div class="right" style="width: 175px; height: 305px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully
to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he
had seen. They all wondered greatly at the many forms
the great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion
said,</p>

<p>"If he is a beast when I go to see him, I
shall roar my loudest, and so frighten him
that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the
lovely lady, I shall pretend to spring upon
her, and so compel her to do my bidding.
And if he is the great Head, he will be at
my mercy; for I will roll this head all about
the room until he promises to give us what
we desire. So be of good cheer my friends
for all will yet be well."</p>

   </div>

<p>The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers
led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him
enter the presence of Oz.</p>

<p>The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing
around saw, to his surprise, that before the throne was
a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he could scarcely
bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was that Oz had
by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but, when
he tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed
his whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer
the door.</p>

<p>Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire,
and these were the words it spoke:</p>

<p>"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.
Who are you, and why do you
seek me?" And the Lion answered,</p>

<p>"I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid
of everything. I come to you to
beg that you give me courage, so
that in reality I may become the
King of Beasts, as men call me."</p>

<p>"Why should I give you courage?"
demanded Oz.</p>

<p>"Because of all Wizards you
are the greatest, and alone have
power to grant my request," answered
the Lion.</p>

</div><!-- i155 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the
voice said,</p>

<p>"Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and
that moment I will give you courage. But so long as the
Witch lives you must remain a coward."</p>

<p>The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say
nothing in reply, and while he stood silently gazing at the
Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail
and rushed from the room. He was glad to find his friends
waiting for him, and told them of his terrible interview
with the Wizard.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy, sadly.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing we can do," returned the
Lion, "and that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek
out the Wicked Witch, and destroy her."</p>

<p>"But suppose we cannot?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"Then I shall never have courage," declared the Lion.</p>

<p>"And I shall never have brains," added the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"And I shall never have a heart," spoke the Tin
Woodman.</p>

<p>"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,"
said Dorothy, beginning to cry.</p>

<p>"Be careful!" cried the green girl, "the tears will fall
on your green silk gown, and spot it."</p>

<p>So Dorothy dried her eyes and said,</p>

<p>"I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want
to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to
kill the Witch," said the Lion.</p>

<p>"I will go too," declared the Scarecrow; "but I shall
not be of much help to you, I am such a fool."</p>

<p>"I haven't the heart to harm even a Witch," remarked
the Tin Woodman; "but if you go I certainly shall go with
you."</p>

<p>Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey
the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe
on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled.
The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy
put new paint on his eyes that he might see better.
The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy's
basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little
bell around Toto's neck with a green ribbon.</p>

<p>They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until
daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a
green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace, and
the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg.</p>

through the streets of the
Emerald City until they reached the
room where the Guardian of the Gates
lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles
to put them back in his great box,
and then he politely opened the gate
for our friends.</p>

<p>"Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?"
asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"There is no road," answered the Guardian of the
Gates; "no one ever wishes to go that way."</p>

<p>"How, then, are we to find her?" enquired the girl.</p>

you, and make you all her slaves."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said the Scarecrow, "for we mean to
destroy her."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is different," said the Guardian of the Gates.
"No one has ever destroyed her before, so
I naturally thought she would make slaves
of you, as she has of all the rest. But take
care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may
not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the
West, where the sun sets, and you cannot
fail to find her."</p>

<p>They thanked him and bade him good-bye,
and turned toward the West, walking
over fields of soft grass dotted here and
there with daisies and buttercups. Dorothy
still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on
in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she
found it was no longer green, but pure white.
The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost
its green color and was as white as Dorothy's
dress.</p>

<p>The Emerald City was soon left far
behind. As they advanced the ground became
rougher and hillier, for there were
no farms nor houses in this country of the
West, and the ground was untilled.</p>

</div><!-- i163 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for
there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before
night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay
down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman
and the Scarecrow keeping watch.</p>

<p>Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one
eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see
everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she
happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep,
with her friends all about her. They were a long distance
off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her
country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung
around her neck.</p>

<p>At once there came running to her from all directions
a pack of great wolves. They had long legs and fierce
eyes and sharp teeth.</p>

<p>"Go to those people," said the Witch, "and tear them
to pieces."</p>

<p>"Are you not going to make them your slaves?"
asked the leader of the wolves.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "one is of tin, and one of straw; one
is a girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to
work, so you may tear them into small pieces."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the wolf, and he dashed away at full
speed, followed by the others.</p>

<p>It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were
wide awake and heard the wolves coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is my fight," said the Woodman; "so get behind
me and I will meet them as they come."</p>

<p>He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp,
and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman
swung his arm and chopped the wolf's head from its
body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could
raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under
the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon. There
were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed; so
that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the
Woodman.</p>

      <div class="left" style="width: 440px; height: 155px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow,
who said,</p>

<p>"It was a good fight, friend."</p>

<p>They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning.
The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great
pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her all.
She thanked him for saving
them and sat down
to breakfast, after which
they started again upon
their journey.</p>

</div><!-- i165 -->

<p>Now this same morning
the Wicked Witch
came to the door of her
castle and looked out
with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
one eye that could see afar off. She saw all her wolves
lying dead, and the strangers still travelling through her
country. This made her angrier than before, and she blew
her silver whistle twice.</p>

<p>Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying
toward her, enough to darken the sky. And the Wicked
Witch said to the King Crow,</p>

<p>"Fly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and
tear them to pieces."</p>

<p>The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy
and her companions. When the little girl saw them
coming she was afraid. But the Scarecrow said,</p>

<p>"This is my battle; so lie down beside me and you will
not be harmed."</p>

<p>So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow,
and he stood up and stretched out his arms. And
when the crows saw him they were frightened, as these
birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come
any nearer. But the King Crow said,</p>

<p>"It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out."</p>

<p>The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it
by the head and twisted its neck until it died. And then
another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrow twisted its
neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the
Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead
beside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and
again they went upon their journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<div class="wrap_area_left">

   <div class="shape_wrap_left">
      <div class="left" style="width: 100%; height: 90px">&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="left" style="width: 170px; height: 65px">&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="left" style="width: 150px; height: 225px">&nbsp;</div>

      <div class="left" style="width: 100%; height: 140px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>When the Wicked Witch looked out again
and saw all her crows lying in a heap, she got
into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon
her silver whistle.</p>

<p>Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the
air, and a swarm of black bees came flying towards her.
"Go to the strangers and sting them to death!" commanded
the Witch, and the bees turned and flew rapidly
until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were
walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming and
the Scarecrow had decided what to do.</p>

<p>"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl
and the dog and the lion," he said to the Woodman,
"and the bees cannot sting them." This the Woodman
did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the
Lion and held Toto in her arms, the straw
covered them entirely.</p>

<p>The bees came and found no one but
the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him
and broke off all their stings against the tin,
without hurting the Woodman at all. And
as bees cannot live when their stings are
broken that was the end of the black bees, and
they lay scattered thick about the Woodman,
like little heaps of fine coal.</p>

</div><!-- i167 -->

<p>Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and
the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as
good as ever. So they started upon their journey once
more.</p>

<p>The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her
black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped
her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth. And
then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the
Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go
to the strangers and destroy them.</p>

<p>The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had
to do as they were told; so they marched away until they
came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar
and sprang toward them, and the poor Winkies were so
frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.</p>

<div class="figright" >
   <a name="i168" id="i168"></a>
   <img src="images/i168_edit.jpg" alt="Toto and bees" title="Toto and bees" />
</div>

<p>When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch
beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their
work, after which she sat down to think what she should do
next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy
these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful
Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her
mind how to act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a
circle of diamonds and rubies running round it. This
Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call
three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey
any order they were given. But no person could command
these strange creatures more than three times.
Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of
the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her
slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The
Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second
time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself,
and driven him out of the land of the West. The
Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only
once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason
she did not like to do so until all her other powers
were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her
wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and
her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly
Lion, she saw there was only one way left
to destroy Dorothy and her friends.</p>

</div><!-- i169 -->

<p>So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap
from her cupboard and placed it upon her head.</p>

<p>Then she stood upon her left foot and
said, slowly, "Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!"</p>

<p>Next she stood upon her right foot
and said, "Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!"</p>

<p>After this she stood upon
both feet and cried in a loud
voice, "Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!"</p>

<p>Now the charm began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling
sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many
wings; a great chattering and laughing; and the sun came
out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded
by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and
powerful wings on his shoulders.</p>

<p>One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their
leader. He flew close to the Witch and said,</p>

<p>"You have called us for the third and last time. What
do you command?"</p>

<p>"Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy
them all except the Lion," said the Wicked Witch.
"Bring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him
like a horse, and make him work."</p>

<p>"Your commands shall be obeyed," said the leader;
and then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the
Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy
and her friends were walking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i170" id="i170"></a>
   <img src="images/i170_edit.jpg" alt="Running Winkies" title="Running Winkies" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and
carried him through the air until they were over a country
thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here they dropped the
poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks,
where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither
move nor groan.</p>

<p>Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and
with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his
clothes and head. They made his hat and boots and
clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top
branches of a tall tree.</p>

<p>The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope
around the Lion and wound many coils about his body
and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch
or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and flew
away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed
in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that
he could not escape.</p>

<p>But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood,
with Toto in her arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades
and thinking it would soon be her turn. The leader
of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy
arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he
saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead
and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i172_edit" id="i172_edit"></a>
   <img src="images/i172_edit.jpg" alt="The Monkeys wound many coils about his body." title="The Monkeys wound many coils about his body." />
   <p class="caption2">"<i>The Monkeys wound many coils about his body.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"We dare not harm this little girl," he said to them,
"for she is protected by the Power of Good, and that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>greater than the Power of Evil. All we can do is to carry
her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there."</p>

<p>So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their
arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they
came to the castle, where they set her down upon the
front door step. Then the leader said to the Witch,</p>

<p>"We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The
Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed, and the
Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girl we dare not
harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your power
over our band is now ended, and you will never see us
again."</p>

<p>Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing
and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon
out of sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i174_edit" id="i174_edit"></a>
   <img src="images/i174_edit.jpg" alt="The Monkey's leader and the Witch." title="The Monkey's leader and the Witch." />
</div>

<p>The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried
when she saw the mark on Dorothy's forehead, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she, herself,
dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked down at
Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to
tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm
belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run
away from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the
child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them
was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful
power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch
laughed to herself, and thought, "I can still make her my
slave, for she does not know how to use her power." Then
she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely,</p>

<p>"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I
tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I
did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow."</p>

<p>Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful
rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where
the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep
the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.</p>

<p>Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made
up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the
Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.</p>

<p>With Dorothy hard at work the Witch thought she
would go into the court-yard and harness the Cowardly
Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to
make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to
drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was
afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.</p>

<p>"If I cannot harness you," said the Witch to the Lion,
speaking through the bars of the gate, "I can starve you.
You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish."</p>

<p>So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion;
but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked,</p>

<p>"Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?"</p>

<p>And the Lion would answer,</p>

<p>"No. If you come in this yard I will bite you."</p>

<p>The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch
wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep
Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard. After he
had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy
would lie beside him and put her head on his soft,
shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried
to plan some way to escape. But they could find no way
to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by
the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked
Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.</p>

<p>The girl had to work hard during the day, and often
the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella
she always carried in her hand. But, in truth, she
did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon
her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full of
fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a
blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and bit her leg, in return. The Witch did not bleed where
she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her
had dried up many years before.</p>

<p>Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand
that it would be harder than ever to get back to
Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would cry
bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking
into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was
for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he
was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was
with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and
that made him unhappy too.</p>

<p>Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have
for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore.
Her Bees and her Crows and her Wolves were lying in
heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of
the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the
Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the
other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully,
to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might
steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes
that she never took them off except at night and when she
took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the
dark to dare go in Dorothy's room at night to take the
shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of
the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing.
Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever
let water touch her in any way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she
finally thought of a trick that would give her what she
wanted. She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the
kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron
invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked
across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able
to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt,
but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off, and before
she could reach it the Witch had snatched it away and put
it on her own skinny foot.</p>

<div class="wrap_area_right">

   <img src="images/i178_edit.jpg" alt="The Witch threatening Toto" title="The Witch threatening Toto" height="370" width="300" />

      <div class="right" style="width: 300px; height: 90px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the
success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the
shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy
could not use it against her, even had
she known how to do so.</p>

<p>The little girl, seeing she had lost one
of her pretty shoes, grew angry,
and said to the Witch,</p>

<p>"Give me back my shoe!"</p>

<p>"I will not," retorted the
Witch, "for it is now my shoe,
and not yours."</p>

<p>"You are a wicked creature!"
cried Dorothy. "You have no right to take
my shoe from me."</p>

</div><!-- i178 -->

<p>"I shall keep it, just the same," said
the Witch, laughing at her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
"and some day I shall get the other one from you,
too."</p>

<p>This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up
the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the
Witch, wetting her from head to foot.</p>

<p>Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear;
and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch
began to shrink and fall away.</p>

<p>"See what you have done!" she screamed. "In a
minute I shall melt away."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, indeed," said Dorothy, who was truly
frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like
brown sugar before her very eyes.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?"
asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice.</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered Dorothy; "how should I?"</p>

<p>"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you
will have the castle to yourself. I have been wicked in
my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would
ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look
out&mdash;here I go!"</p>

<p>With these words the Witch fell down in a brown,
melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean
boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she had really
melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of
water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all
out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and
dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then,
being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the
court-yard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the
West had come to an end, and that they were no longer
prisoners in a strange land.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies,

<p>"Don't you suppose we could rescue them?" asked
the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>"We can try," answered the Lion.</p>

<p>So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if
they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies
said that they would be delighted to do all in their power
for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage. So
she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if
they knew the most, and they all started away. They
travelled that day and part of the next until they came to
the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered
and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted
and the handle broken off short.</p>

<p>The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and
carried him back to the yellow castle again, Dorothy shedding
a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old
friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry. When they
reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies,</p>

<p>"Are any of your people tinsmiths?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; some of us are very good tinsmiths," they
told her.</p>

<p>"Then bring them to me," she said. And when the
tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in
baskets, she enquired,</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i186" id="i186"></a>
   <img src="images/i186_edit.jpg" alt="The Tinsmiths worked for three days and four nights." title="The Tinsmiths worked for three days and four nights." />
   <p class="caption2">"<i>The Tinsmiths worked for three days and four nights.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>and bend him back into shape again, and solder him
together where he is broken?"</p>

<p>The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully
and then answered that they thought they could mend him
so he would be as good as ever. So they set to work in
one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for
three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and
bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the
legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last
he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints
worked as well as ever. To be sure, there were several
patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as
the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the
patches at all.</p>

<p>When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and
thanked her for rescuing him, he was so pleased that he
wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every tear
carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would
not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick
and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and
these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the
Lion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail
that it became quite wet, and he was obliged to go out into
the court-yard and hold it in the sun till it dried.</p>

<p>"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again," said
the Tin Woodman, when Dorothy had finished telling him
everything that had happened, "I should be quite happy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must try to find him," said the girl.</p>

<p>So she called the Winkies to help her, and they
walked all that day and part of the next until they came
to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged
Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.</p>

<p>It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth
that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once,</p>

<p>"I'll chop it down, and then we can get the Scarecrow's
clothes."</p>

<p>Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending
the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a
goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted
it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old broken handle.
Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed
and it glistened like burnished silver.</p>

<p>As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began
to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash,
when the Scarecrow's clothes fell out of the branches and
rolled off on the ground.</p>

<p>Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry
them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice,
clean straw; and, behold! here was the Scarecrow, as good
as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.</p>

<p>Now they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends
spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they
found everything they needed to make them comfortable.
But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must go back to Oz, and claim his promise."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Woodman, "at last I shall get my
heart."</p>

<p>"And I shall get my brains," added the Scarecrow,
joyfully.</p>

<p>"And I shall get my courage," said the Lion, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And I shall get back to Kansas," cried Dorothy,
clapping her hands. "Oh, let us start for the Emerald
City to-morrow!"</p>

<p>This they decided to do. The next day they called
the Winkies together and bade them good-bye. The
Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown
so fond of the Tin Woodman
that they begged him to stay and
rule over them and the Yellow
Land of the West. Finding they
were determined to go, the
Winkies gave Toto and the Lion
each a golden collar; and to Dorothy
they presented a beautiful
bracelet, studded with diamonds;
and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking
stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman
they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set
with precious jewels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one of the travellers made the Winkies a
pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them
until their arms ached.</p>

<p>Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her
basket with food for the journey, and there she saw the
Golden Cap. She tried it on her own head and found that
it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything about the
charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty,
so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet
in the basket.</p>

<p>Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started
for the Emerald City; and the Winkies gave them three
cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">You </span>will remember
there was no road&mdash;not even
a pathway&mdash;between the castle of the
Wicked Witch and the Emerald City.
When the four travellers went in search
of the Witch she had seen them coming,
and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring
them to her. It was much harder to find their way back
through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies
than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must
go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off
in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over
their heads, they did not know which was east and which
was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the
great fields. They kept on walking, however,
and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So
they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers
and slept soundly until morning&mdash;all but the Scarecrow
and the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but
they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they
were going.</p>

<p>"If we walk far enough," said Dorothy, "we shall
sometime come to some place, I am sure."</p>

<p>But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing
before them but the yellow fields. The Scarecrow began
to grumble a bit.</p>

<p>"We have surely lost our way," he said, "and unless
we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City I shall
never get my brains."</p>

<p>"Nor I my heart," declared the Tin Woodman. "It
seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you
must admit this is a very long journey."</p>

<p>"You see," said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper,
"I haven't the courage to keep tramping forever, without
getting anywhere at all."</p>

<p>Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass
and looked at her companions, and they sat down and
looked at her, and Toto found that for the first time in his
life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that
flew past his head; so he put out his tongue
and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask
what they should do next.</p>

<p>"Suppose we call the Field Mice," she suggested.
"They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City."</p>

</div><!-- i195 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure they could," cried the Scarecrow; "why
didn't we think of that before?"</p>

<p>Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried
about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to
her. In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny
feet, and many of the small grey mice came running up
to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked,
in her squeaky little voice,</p>

<p>"What can I do for my friends?"</p>

<p>"We have lost our way," said Dorothy. "Can you
tell us where the Emerald City is?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the Queen; "but it
is a great way off, for you have had it at your
backs all this time." Then she
noticed Dorothy's Golden Cap,
and said, "Why don't you use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to
you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than
an hour."</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was a charm," answered Dorothy,
in surprise. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is written inside the Golden Cap," replied the Queen
of the Mice; "but if you are going to call the Winged
Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief
and think it great fun to plague us."</p>

<p>"Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; they must obey the wearer of the Cap.
Good-bye!" And she scampered out of sight, with all the
mice hurrying after her.</p>

<p>Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some
words written upon the lining. These, she thought, must
be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put
the Cap upon her head.</p>

<p>"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her
left foot.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked the Scarecrow, who did
not know what she was doing.</p>

<p>"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went on, standing
this time on her right foot.</p>

<p>"Hello!" replied the Tin Woodman, calmly.</p>

   <p class="caption2">"<i>The Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now
standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm,
and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them. The
King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked,</p>

<p>"What is your command?"</p>

<p>"We wish to go to the Emerald City," said the child,
"and we have lost our way."</p>

<p>"We will carry you," replied the King, and no sooner
had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy
in their arms and flew away with her. Others took the
Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little
Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog
tried hard to bite him.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather
frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the
Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw
that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air
quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty
gardens and woods far below them.</p>

<p>Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of
the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself. They
had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to
hurt her.</p>

<p>"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden
Cap?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is a long story," answered the King, with a
laugh; "but as we have a long journey before us I will
pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to hear it," she replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once," began the leader, "we were a free people,
living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree,
eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without
calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us were rather
too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails
of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and
throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But
we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed
every minute of the day. This was many years ago, long
before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land.</p>

<p>"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful
princess, who was also a powerful sorceress. All her
magic was used to help the people, and she was never
known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was
Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from
great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest
sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return,
since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate
with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she
found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond
his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when
he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so
she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic
powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any
woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala,
as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man
in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything
ready for the wedding.</p>

   </div>

<p>"My grandfather was at that time the King of the
Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayalette's
palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good
dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather
was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking
beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink
silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he
would see what he could do. At his word the band
flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms
until they were over the middle of the river, and then
dropped him into the water.</p>

<p>"'Swim out, my fine fellow,'" cried my grandfather,
"'and see if the water has spotted your clothes.'" Quelala
was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the
least spoiled by all his good fortune. He laughed, when
he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.
But when Gayelette came running out to him she found
his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.</p>

</div><!-- i202 -->

<p>"The princess was very angry, and she knew, of course,
who did it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought
before her, and she said at first that their wings should
be tied and they should be treated as they had treated
Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather
pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in
the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them,
on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after
do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden
Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to
Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her
kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other
Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how
it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner
of the Golden Cap, whomsoever he may be."</p>

<p>"And what became of them?" asked Dorothy, who
had been greatly interested in the story.</p>

<p>"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,"
replied the Monkey, "he was the first to lay his wishes
upon us. As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he
called us all to him in the forest after he had married her
and ordered us to always keep where she could never again
set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do,
for we were all afraid of her.</p>

<p>"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap
fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who
made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz
himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden
Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay
your wishes upon us."</p>

<p>As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy
looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the
Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over.
The strange creatures set the travellers down carefully
before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy,
and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.</p>

<p>"That was a good ride," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles." replied the
Lion. "How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful
Cap!"</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The </span>four travellers walked up to the
great gate of the Emerald City
and rang the bell. After ringing
several times it was opened by the
same Guardian of the Gate they had met
before.</p>

<p>"What! are you back again?" he asked,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you not see us?" answered the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked
Witch of the West."</p>

<p>"We did visit her," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"And she let you go again?" asked the man, in
wonder.</p>

<p>"She could not help it, for she is melted," explained
the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed," said the
man. "Who melted her?"</p>

</div><!-- i208 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was Dorothy," said the Lion, gravely.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed the man, and he bowed
very low indeed before her.</p>

<p>Then he led them into his little room and locked the
spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he
had done before. Afterward they passed on through the
gate into the Emerald City, and when the people heard
from the Guardian of the Gate that they had melted the
Wicked Witch of the West they all gathered around the
travellers and followed them in a great crowd to the
Palace of Oz.</p>

<p>The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard
before the door, but he let them in at once and they were
again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each
of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until
the Great Oz was ready to receive them.</p>

<p>The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that
Dorothy and the other travellers had come back again,
after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply.
They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at
once, but he did not. They had no word from him the
next day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was
tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending
them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow
at last asked the green girl to take another message
to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once
they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and
find out whether he kept his promises or not. When the
Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that
he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at
four minutes after nine o'clock the next morning. He had
once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West,
and he did not wish to meet them again.</p>

<p>The four travellers passed a sleepless night, each
thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow upon him.
Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she
was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad
she was to have her little girl at home again.</p>

<p>Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green
whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later
they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.</p>

<p>Of course each one of them expected to see the
Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were
greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one
at all in the room. They kept close to the door and closer
to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was
more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz
take.</p>

</div><!-- i210 -->

<p>Presently they heard a Voice, seeming to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it
said, solemnly.</p>

<p>"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you
seek me?"</p>

<p>They looked again in every part of the room, and
then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked,</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"I am everywhere," answered the Voice, "but to the
eyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now seat
myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me."
Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from
the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a
row while Dorothy said:</p>

<p>"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz."</p>

<p>"What promise?" asked Oz.</p>

<p>"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the
Wicked Witch was destroyed," said the girl.</p>

<p>"And you promised to give me brains," said the
Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"And you promised to give me a heart," said the Tin
Woodman.</p>

<p>"And you promised to give me courage," said the
Cowardly Lion.</p>

<p>"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?" asked the
Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I melted her with a bucket of
water."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me," said the Voice; "how sudden! Well, come
to me to-morrow, for I must have time to think it
over."</p>

<p>"You've had plenty of time already," said the Tin
Woodman, angrily.</p>

<p>"We shan't wait a day longer," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"You must keep your promises to us!" exclaimed
Dorothy.</p>

<p>The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the
Wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce
and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm
and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner. As it
fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next
moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they
saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little,
old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who
seemed to be as much surprised as they were. The Tin
Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the
little man and cried out,</p>

</div><!-- i212 -->

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Oz, the Great
and Terrible," said the
little man, in a trembling
voice, "but don't strike
me&mdash;please don't!&mdash;and
I'll do anything you want
me to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>"I thought Oz was a great Head," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady," said the
Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast," said the Tin
Woodman.</p>

<p>"And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire," exclaimed the
Lion.</p>

<p>"No; you are all wrong," said the little man, meekly.
"I have been making believe."</p>

<p>"Making believe!" cried Dorothy. "Are you not a
great Wizard?"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear," he said; "don't speak so loud, or you
will be overheard&mdash;and I should be ruined. I'm supposed
to be a Great Wizard."</p>

<p>"And aren't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man."</p>

<p>"You're more than that," said the Scarecrow, in a
grieved tone; "you're a humbug."</p>

<p>"Exactly so!" declared the little man, rubbing his
hands together as if it pleased him; "I am a humbug."</p>

<p>"But this is terrible," said the Tin Woodman; "how
shall I ever get my heart?"</p>

<p>"Or I my courage?" asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Or I my brains?" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the
the tears from his eyes with his coat-sleeve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">"<i>Exactly so! I am a humbug.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"My dear friends," said Oz, "I pray you not to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>of these little things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble
I'm in at being found out."</p>

<p>"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?" asked
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No one knows it but you four&mdash;and myself," replied
Oz. "I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I
should never be found out. It was a great mistake my
ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will
not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something
terrible."</p>

<p>"But, I don't understand," said Dorothy, in bewilderment.
"How was it that you appeared to me as a great
Head?"</p>

<p>"That was one of my tricks," answered Oz. "Step
this way, please, and I will tell you all about it."</p>

<p>He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the
Throne Room, and they all followed him. He pointed to
one corner, in which lay the Great Head, made out of
many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted
face.</p>

<p>"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire," said Oz; "I
stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the
eyes move and the mouth open."</p>

<p>"But how about the voice?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am a ventriloquist," said the little man, "and I
can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish; so that
you thought it was coming out of the Head. Here are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the other things I used to deceive you." He showed the
Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he
seemed to be the lovely Lady; and the Tin Woodman saw
that his Terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn
together, with slats to keep their sides out. As for the
Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the
ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was
poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.</p>

<p>"Really," said the Scarecrow, "you ought to be
ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug."</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;I certainly am," answered the little man, sorrowfully;
"but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down,
please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my
story."</p>

<p>So they sat down and listened while he told the following
tale:</p>

<p>"I was born in Omaha&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No; but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his
head at her, sadly. "When I grew up I became a ventriloquist,
and at that I was very well trained by a great master.
I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast." Here he
mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and
looked everywhere to see where she was. "After a time,"
continued Oz, "I tired of that, and became a balloonist."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as
to draw a crowd of people together and
get them to pay to see the circus," he
explained.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said; "I know."</p>

<p>"Well, one day I went up in a balloon
and the ropes got twisted, so that
I couldn't come down again. It went
way up above the clouds, so far that a
current of air struck it and carried it
many, many miles away. For a day
and a night I travelled through the air, and on the morning
of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating
over a strange and beautiful country.</p>

<p>"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit.
But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who,
seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great
Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were
afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished
them to.</p>

<p>"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy,
I ordered them to build this City, and my palace; and they
did it all willingly and well. Then I thought, as the country
was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald
City, and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles
on all the people, so that everything they saw was green."</p>

<p>"But isn't everything here green?" asked Dorothy.</p>

</div><!-- i218 -->

<p>"No more than in any other city," replied Oz; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything
you see looks green to you. The Emerald City was built
a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the
balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now.
But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so
long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City,
and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels
and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed
to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and
they like me; but ever since this Palace was built I have
shut myself up and would not see any of them.</p>

<p>"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while
I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the
Witches were really able to do wonderful things. There
were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people
who live in the North and South and East and West.
Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were
good, and I knew they would do me no harm; but the
Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and
had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves,
they would surely have destroyed me. As it was,
I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can
imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had
fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East. When you came
to me I was willing to promise anything if you would only
do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have
melted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my
promises."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you are a very bad man," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man; but
I'm a very bad Wizard, I must admit."</p>

<p>"Can't you give me brains?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"You don't need them. You are learning something
every day. A baby has brains, but it doesn't know much.
Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and
the longer you are on earth the more experience you are
sure to get."</p>

<p>"That may all be true," said the Scarecrow, "but I

<p>The false wizard looked at him carefully.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with a sigh, "I'm not much of a magician,
as I said; but if you will come to me to-morrow
morning, I will stuff your head with brains. I cannot tell
you how to use them, however; you must find that out for
yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you!" cried the Scarecrow.
"I'll find a way to use
them, never fear!"</p>

<p>"But how about my courage?"
asked the Lion, anxiously.</p>

</div><!-- i220 -->

<p>"You have plenty of courage,
I am sure," answered Oz.
"All you need is confidence in
yourself. There is no living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. True courage

<p>"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same," said
the Lion. "I shall really be very unhappy unless you give
me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will give you that sort of courage to-morrow,"
replied Oz.</p>

<p>"How about my heart?" asked the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"Why, as for that," answered Oz, "I think you are
wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy.
If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart."</p>

<p>"That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin
Woodman. "For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness
without a murmur, if you will give me the heart."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Oz, meekly. "Come
to me to-morrow and you shall have a heart. I
have played Wizard for so many years that I may
as well continue the part a little longer."</p>

<p>"And now," said Dorothy, "how
am I to get back to Kansas?"</p>

</div><!-- i221 -->

<p>"We shall have to think about that,"
replied the little man, "Give me two
or three days to consider the matter
and I'll try to find a way to carry you
over the desert. In the meantime you
shall all be treated as my guests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you
and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I
ask in return for my help&mdash;such as it is. You must keep
my secret and tell no one I am a humbug."</p>

<p>They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned,
and went back to their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy
had hope that "The Great and Terrible Humbug," as
she called him, would find a way to send her back to
Kansas, and if he did that she was willing to forgive him
everything.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Next </span>morning the
Scarecrow said to his
friends:</p>

<p>"Congratulate me. I am going
to Oz to get my brains at last.
When I return I shall be as other
men are."</p>

<p>"I have always liked you as
you were," said Dorothy, simply.</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied.
"But surely you will think more of me when you hear the
splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out."
Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and
went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Oz.</p>

</div><!-- i226 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting
down by the window, engaged in deep thought.</p>

<p>"I have come for my brains," remarked the Scarecrow,
a little uneasily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz.
"You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall
have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper
place."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the Scarecrow. "You are quite
welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better
one when you put it on again."</p>

<p>So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out
the straw. Then he entered the back room and took up a
measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins
and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly,
he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture
and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in
place. When he had fastened the Scarecrow's head on
his body again he said to him,</p>

<p>"Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given
you a lot of bran-new brains."</p>

<p>The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the
fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz
warmly he went back to his friends.</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at him curiously. His head was
quite bulging out at the top with brains.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I feel wise, indeed," he answered, earnestly. "When
I get used to my brains I shall know everything."</p>

<p>"Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your
head?" asked the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart," said the
Woodman. So he walked to the Throne Room and
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," called Oz, and the Woodman entered and
said,</p>

<p>"I have come for my heart."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the little man. "But I shall
have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart
in the right place. I hope it won't hurt you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no;" answered the Woodman. "I shall not feel
it at all."</p>

<p>So Oz brought a pair of tinners' shears and cut a
small, square hole in the
left side of the Tin Woodman's
breast. Then, going
to a chest of drawers, he
took out a pretty heart,
made entirely of silk and
stuffed with sawdust.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a beauty?" he
asked.</p>

</div><!-- i230 -->

<p>"It is, indeed!" replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. "But is it a kind
heart?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very!" answered Oz. He put the heart in the
Woodman's breast and then replaced the square of tin,
soldering it neatly together where it had been cut.</p>

<p>"There," said he; "now you have a heart that any man
might be proud of. I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your
breast, but it really couldn't be helped."</p>

<p>"Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman.
"I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget
your kindness."</p>

<p>Then the Tin Woodman went back to his
friends, who wished him every joy on account of
his good fortune.</p>

<p>The Lion now walked to the Throne
Room and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Oz.</p>

<p>"I have come for my courage," announced
the Lion, entering the room.</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the little
man; "I will get it for you."</p>

</div><!-- i231 -->

<p>He went to a cupboard
and reaching up to a high
shelf took down a
square green bottle,
the contents of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved.
Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it
as if he did not like it, the Wizard said,</p>

<p>"Drink."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Oz, "if it were inside of you, it would
be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always
inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage
until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise you to
drink it as soon as possible."</p>

<p>The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish
was empty.</p>

<p>"How do you feel now?" asked Oz.</p>

<p>"Full of courage," replied the Lion, who went joyfully
back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.</p>

<p>Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in
giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion
exactly what they thought they wanted. "How can I help
being a humbug," he said, "when all these people make
me do things that everybody knows can't be done? It
was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the
Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything.
But it will take more than imagination to carry
Dorothy back to Kansas, and I'm sure I don't know how
it can be done."</p>

<p><span class="firstword">For </span>three days Dorothy heard
nothing from Oz. These
were sad days for the little
girl, although her friends were all quite happy and
contented. The Scarecrow told them there were
wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not
say what they were because he knew no one could
understand them but himself. When the Tin
Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling
around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered
it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one
he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared
he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly
face an army of men or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.</p>

<p>Thus each of the little party was satisfied except
Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to
Kansas.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her,
and when she entered the Throne Room he said, pleasantly:</p>

</div><!-- i236 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to
get you out of this country."</p>

<p>"And back to Kansas?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure about Kansas," said Oz; "for I
haven't the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first
thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be
easy to find your way home."</p>

<p>"How can I cross the desert?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what I think," said the little man.
"You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon.
You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone.
So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be
through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers to
make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over,
and I believe I can make a balloon."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"A balloon," said Oz, "is made of silk, which is coated
with glue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in
the Palace, so it will be no trouble for us to make the balloon.
But in all this country there is no gas to fill the
balloon with, to make it float."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it won't float," remarked Dorothy, "it will be of no
use to us."</p>

<p>"True," answered Oz. "But there is another way to
make it float, which is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn't
as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon
would come down in the desert, and we should be lost."</p>

<p>"We!" exclaimed the girl; "are you going with me?"</p>

<div class="wrap_area_right">

   <img src="images/i238_edit.jpg" alt="Toto scaring the wizard" title="Toto scaring the wizard" height="324" width="300" />

   <div class="shape_wrap_left">
      <div class="right" style="width: 150px; height: 140px">&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="right" style="width: 195px; height: 85px">&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="right" style="width: 300px; height: 100px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"Yes, of course," replied Oz. "I am tired of being such
a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people
would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they
would be vexed with me for having deceived them. So I
have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets
tiresome. I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you
and be in a circus again."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have your company,"
said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered. "Now, if
you will help me sew the silk together, we
will begin to work on our balloon."</p>

</div><!-- i238 -->

<p>So Dorothy took a needle and thread,
and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into
proper shape the girl sewed them neatly
together. First there was a strip of
light green silk, then a strip of dark
green and then a strip of emerald
green; for Oz had a fancy to make
the balloon in different shades of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips
together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of
green silk more than twenty feet long.</p>

<p>Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin
glue, to make it air-tight, after which he announced that
the balloon was ready.</p>

<p>"But we must have a basket to ride in," he said. So
he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big
clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the
bottom of the balloon.</p>

<p>When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people
that he was going to make a visit to a great brother
Wizard who lived in the clouds. The news spread rapidly
throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful
sight.</p>

<p>Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the
Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity.
The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood, and
now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the
balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it
would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon
swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket
just touched the ground.</p>

<p>Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people
in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"I am now going away to make a visit. While I am
gone the Scarecrow will rule over you. I command you
to obey him as you would me."</p>

      <div class="right2" style="width: 140px; height: 405px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope
that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and
this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without
that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.</p>

<p>"Come, Dorothy!" cried the Wizard; "hurry up, or the
balloon will fly away."</p>

<p>"I can't find Toto anywhere," replied Dorothy, who
did not wish to leave her little dog behind. Toto had run
into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at
last found him. She picked him up and ran toward
the balloon.</p>

<p>She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was
holding out his hands to help her into the basket,
when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose
into the air without
her.</p>

<p>"Come back!"
she screamed; "I
want to go, too!"</p>

<p>"I can't come
back, my dear," called
Oz from the basket.
"Good-bye!"</p>

</div><!-- i240 -->

<p>"Good-bye!"
shouted everyone,
and all eyes were
turned upward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every
moment farther and farther into the sky.</p>

<p>And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz,
the Wonderful Wizard, though he may have reached
Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But
the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one
another,</p>

<p>"Oz was always our friend. When he was here he
built for us this beautiful Emerald City, and now he is
gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us."</p>

<p>Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the
Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Dorothy </span>wept bitterly at the passing of
her hope to get home to Kansas
again; but when she thought it
all over she was glad she had not
gone up in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing
Oz, and so did her companions.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman came to her and said,</p>

<p>"Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for
the man who gave me my lovely heart. I should like to
cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away
my tears, so that I shall not rust."</p>

</div><!-- i244 -->

<p>"With pleasure," she answered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
brought a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept
for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully
and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished
he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly
with his jewelled oil-can, to guard against mishap.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald
City, and although he was not a Wizard the people were
proud of him. "For," they said, "there is not another city
in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man." And, so
far as they knew, they were quite right.</p>

<p>The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz
the four travellers met in the Throne Room and talked
matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and
the others stood respectfully before him.</p>

<p>"We are not so unlucky," said the new ruler; "for this
Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do
just as we please. When I remember that a short time
ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield, and that I
am now the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied
with my lot."</p>

<p>"I also," said the Tin Woodman, "am well pleased
with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I
wished in all the world."</p>

<p>"For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave
as any beast that ever lived, if not braver," said the Lion,
modestly,</p>

   <p class="caption2">"<i>The Scarecrow sat on the big throne.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>Emerald City," continued the Scarecrow, "we might all
be happy together."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to live here," cried Dorothy. "I
want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle
Henry."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what can be done?" enquired the Woodman.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so
hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his
brains. Finally he said:</p>

<p>"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and asked them
to carry you over the desert?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that!" said Dorothy, joyfully.
"It's just the thing. I'll go at once for the Golden Cap."</p>

<p>When she brought it into the Throne Room she
spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged
Monkeys flew in through an open window and stood beside
her.</p>

<p>"This is the second time you have called us," said the
Monkey King, bowing before the little girl. "What do
you wish?"</p>

<p>"I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>But the Monkey King shook his head.</p>

      <div class="left" style="width: 135px; height: 250px">&nbsp;</div>
   </div>

<p>"That cannot be done," he said. "We belong to this
country alone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a
Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never
will be, for they don't belong there. We shall be glad to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross
the desert. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And with another bow the Monkey King spread
his wings and flew away through the window, followed
by all his band.</p>

<p>Dorothy was almost ready to cry with disappointment.</p>

<p>"I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to
no purpose," she said, "for the Winged Monkeys cannot
help me."</p>

<p>"It is certainly too bad!" said the tender hearted
Woodman.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head
bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would
burst.</p>

<p>"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,"
he said, "and ask his advice."</p>

<p>So the soldier was summoned
and entered the
Throne Room timidly, for
while Oz was alive he never
was allowed to come further than the door.</p>

<p>"This little girl," said the Scarecrow to the
soldier, "wishes to cross the desert. How can she
do so?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," answered the soldier; "for nobody
has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself."</p>

</div><!-- i249 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there no one who can help me?" asked Dorothy,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Glinda might," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Who is Glinda?" enquired the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful
of all the Witches, and rules over the Quadlings. Besides,
her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she may
know a way to cross it."</p>

<p>"Glinda is a good Witch, isn't she?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier,
"and she is kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is
a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite
of the many years she has lived."</p>

<p>"How can I get to her castle?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but
it is said to be full of dangers to travellers. There are
wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who
do not like strangers to cross their country. For this
reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald
City."</p>

<p>The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said,</p>

<p>"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing
Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and
ask Glinda to help her. For, of course, if Dorothy stays
here she will never get back to Kansas."</p>

<p>"You must have been thinking again," remarked the
Tin Woodman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"I shall go with Dorothy," declared the Lion, "for I
am tired of your city and long for the woods and the
country again. I am really a wild beast, you know. Besides,
Dorothy will need someone to protect her."</p>

<p>"That is true," agreed the Woodman. "My axe may
be of service to her; so I, also, will go with her to the Land
of the South."</p>

<p>"When shall we start?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>


<p>"Are you going?" they asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never
have had brains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield
and brought me to the Emerald City. So my good
luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she
starts back to Kansas for good and all."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dorothy, gratefully.
"You are all very kind to me. But I should like
to start as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"We shall go to-morrow morning," returned
the Scarecrow. "So now let us all get
ready, for it will be a long journey."</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The </span>next morning Dorothy
kissed the pretty green girl
good-bye, and they all shook
hands with the soldier with
the green whiskers, who had
walked with them as far as the gate.
When the Guardian of the Gate saw them
again he wondered greatly that they could
leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But he
at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into
the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry
with them.</p>

<p>"You are now our ruler," he said to the Scarecrow;
"so you must come back to us as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall if I am able," the Scarecrow replied;
"but I must help Dorothy to get home, first."</p>

<p>As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last
farewell she said,</p>

</div><!-- i254 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City,
and everyone has been good to me. I cannot tell you how
grateful I am."</p>

<p>"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like
to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to
Kansas I hope you will find a way." He then opened the
gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started
upon their journey.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their
faces toward the Land of the South. They were all in
the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together.
Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting
home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were
glad to be of use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the
fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side
in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran
around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking
merrily all the time.</p>

<p>"City life does not agree with me at all," remarked
the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace. "I have
lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious
for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous
I have grown."</p>

<p>They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald
City. All they could see was a mass of towers and
steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything
the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.</p>

<p>"Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all," said the
Tin Woodman, as he felt his heart rattling around in his
breast.</p>

<p>"He knew how to give me brains, and very good
brains, too," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave
me," added the Lion, "he would have been a brave man."</p>

<p>Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise
he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him.
As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad
Wizard.</p>

<p>The first day's journey was through the green fields
and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City
on every side. They slept that night on the grass, with
nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well
indeed.</p>

<p>In the morning they travelled on until they came to
a thick wood. There was no way of going around it, for
it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they
could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the
direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they
looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into
the forest.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered
a big tree with such wide spreading-branches that
there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he
walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the
first branches they bent down and twined around him, and
the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung
headlong among his fellow travellers.</p>

<p>This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised
him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked
him up.</p>

<p>"Here is another space between the trees," called the
Lion.</p>

<p>"Let me try it first," said the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't
hurt me to get thrown about." He walked up to another
tree, as he spoke, but its
branches immediately seized
him and tossed him back
again.</p>

<p>"This is strange," exclaimed
Dorothy; "what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>"The trees seem to
have made up their minds to
fight us, and stop our journey,"
remarked the Lion.</p>

</div><!-- i259 -->

<p>"I believe I will try it
myself," said the Woodman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree
that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly. When
a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman
chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the
tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the
Tin Woodman passed safely under it.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he shouted to the others; "be quick!"</p>

<p>They all ran forward and passed under the tree without
injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch
and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly
chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.</p>

<p>The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep
them back, so they made up their minds that only the first
row of trees could bend down their branches, and that
probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given
this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.</p>

<p>The four travellers walked with ease through the
trees until they came to the further edge of the wood.
Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high
wall, which seemed to be made of white china. It was
smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their
heads.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I will make a ladder," said the Tin Woodman, "for
we certainly must climb over the wall."</p>

<p><span class="firstword">While </span>the Woodman
was making a
ladder from
wood which he found
in the forest Dorothy lay down and
slept, for she was tired by the long walk.
The Lion also curled himself up to
sleep and Toto lay beside him.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow watched the Woodman
while he worked, and said to him:</p>

<p>"I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is
made of."</p>

<p>"Rest your brains and do not worry about the
wall," replied the Woodman; "when we have climbed
over it we shall know what is on the other side."</p>

<p>After a time the ladder was finished. It looked
clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and
would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothy
and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder
was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first,
but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close
behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his
head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said,</p>

</div><!-- i264 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my!"</p>

<p>"Go on," exclaimed Dorothy.</p>

<p>So the Scarecrow climbed further up and sat down
on the top of the wall, and Dorothy put her head over and
cried,</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" just as the Scarecrow had done.</p>

<p>Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark,
but Dorothy made him be still.</p>

<p>The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin
Woodman came last; but both of them cried, "Oh, my!"
as soon as they looked over the wall. When they were
all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down
and saw a strange sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i266" id="i266"></a>
   <img src="images/i266_edit.jpg" alt="These people were all made of china." title="These people were all made of china." />
   <p class="caption2">"<i>These people were all made of china.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>Before them was a great stretch of country having a
floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big
platter. Scattered around were many houses made entirely
of china and painted in the brightest colours. These
houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>as high as Dorothy's waist. There were also pretty little
barns, with china fences around them, and many cows and
sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china,
were standing about in groups.</p>

<p>But the strangest of all were the people who lived in
this queer country. There were milk-maids and shepherdesses,
with bright-colored bodices and golden spots all
over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous
frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds
dressed in knee-breeches with pink and yellow and blue
stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes;
and princes with jewelled crowns upon their heads, wearing
ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in
ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and
tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were
all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small
that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy's
knee.</p>

<p>No one did so much as look at the travellers at first,
except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head,
which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice,
afterwards running away again.</p>

<p>"How shall we get down?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull
it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others
jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not
hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were
safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body
was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape
again.</p>

<p>"We must cross this strange place in order to get to
the other side," said Dorothy; "for it would be unwise for
us to go any other way except due South."</p>

<p>They began walking through the country of the china
people, and the first thing they came to was a china milk-maid
milking a china cow. As they drew near the cow
suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail,
and even the milk-maid herself, all falling on the china
ground with a great clatter.</p>

<p>Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken
her leg short off, and that the pail was lying in several
small pieces, while the poor milk-maid had a nick in her
left elbow.</p>

<p>"There!" cried the milk-maid, angrily; "see what you
have done! My cow has broken her leg, and I must take
her to the mender's shop and have it glued on again. What
do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?"</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," returned Dorothy; "please forgive
us."</p>

<p>But the pretty milk-maid was much too vexed to
make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led
her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As
she left them the milk-maid cast many reproachful glances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her
nicked elbow close to her side.</p>

<p>Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.</p>

<p>"We must be very careful here," said the
kind-hearted Woodman, "or we may hurt these
pretty little people so they will never get
over it."</p>

<p>A little farther on Dorothy met a most
beautiful dressed young princess, who stopped
short as she saw the strangers and started to
run away.</p>

<p>Dorothy wanted to see more of the
Princess, so she ran after her; but the china girl
cried out,</p>

<p>"Don't chase me! don't chase me!"</p>

<p>She had such a frightened little voice that
Dorothy stopped and said,</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered the princess, also stopping,
a safe distance away, "if I run I may fall
down and break myself."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you be mended?" asked
the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty
after being mended, you know," replied the
princess.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Dorothy.</p>

</div><!-- i270 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns," continued
the china lady, "who is always trying to stand upon his
head. He has broken himself so often that he is mended
in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all pretty. Here
he comes now, so you can see for yourself."</p>

<p>Indeed, a jolly little Clown now came walking toward
them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty
clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely
covered with cracks, running every which way and showing
plainly that he had been mended in many places.</p>

<p>The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after
puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily
he said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"My lady fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Why do you stare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At poor old Mr. Joker?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You're quite as stiff<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And prim as if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd eaten up a poker!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Be quiet, sir!" said the princess; "can't you see these
are strangers, and should be treated with respect?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's respect, I expect," declared the Clown,
and immediately stood upon his head.</p>

<p>"Don't mind Mr. Joker," said the princess to Dorothy;
"he is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes
him foolish."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind him
a bit," said Dorothy. "But
you are so beautiful," she
continued, "that I am sure
I could love you dearly.
Won't you let me carry
you back to Kansas and
stand you on Aunt
Em's mantle-shelf?
I could carry you in
my basket."</p>

<p>"That would
make me very unhappy,"
answered
the china princess.
"You see, here in our
own country we live
contentedly, and can
talk and move around
as we please. But
whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once
stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty.
Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on
mantle-shelves and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but
our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country."</p>

</div><!-- i272 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would not make you unhappy for all the world!"
exclaimed Dorothy; "so I'll just say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," replied the princess.</p>

<p>They walked carefully through the china country.
The little animals and all the people scampered out of
their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and
after an hour or so the travellers reached the other side of
the country and came to another china wall.</p>

<p>It was not as high as the first, however, and by
standing upon the Lion's back they all managed to scramble
to the top. Then the Lion gathered his legs under
him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped he
upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to
pieces.</p>

<p>"That was too bad," said Dorothy, "but really I think
we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm
than breaking a cow's leg and a church. They are all so
brittle!"</p>

<p>"They are, indeed," said the Scarecrow, "and I am
thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged.
There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow."</p>

<p><span class="firstword">After </span>climbing down from
the china wall the
travellers found
themselves in a disagreeable
country, full of bogs and marshes
and covered with tall, rank grass.
It was difficult to walk far without
falling into muddy holes, for the
grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However,
by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until
they reached solid ground. But here the
country seemed wilder than ever, and after
a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush
they entered another forest, where
the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever
seen.</p>

</div><!-- i276 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"This forest is perfectly delightful," declared the Lion,
looking around him with joy; "never have I seen a more
beautiful place."</p>

<p>"It seems gloomy," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," answered the Lion; "I should like
to live here all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are
under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that
clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast could wish
a pleasanter home."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I suppose there are," returned the Lion; "but I do
not see any of them about."</p>

<p>They walked through the forest until it became too
dark to go any farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion
lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow
kept watch over them as usual.</p>

<p>When morning came they started again. Before
they had gone far they heard a low rumble, as of the growling
of many wild animals. Toto whimpered a little but
none of the others was frightened and they kept along the
well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the
wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every
variety. There were tigers and elephants and bears and
wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But the Lion explained
that the animals were holding a meeting, and he
judged by their snarling and growling that they were in
great trouble.</p>

<p>As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him,
and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic.
The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed,
saying,</p>

   </div>

<p>"Welcome, O King of
Beasts! You have come in
good time to fight our enemy
and bring peace to all the
animals of the forest once
more."</p>

<p>"What is your trouble?"
asked the Lion, quietly.</p>

<p>"We are all threatened,"
answered the tiger, "by a
fierce enemy which has lately
come into this
forest. It is a
most tremendous
monster, like a
great spider, with
a body as big as
an elephant and
legs as long as a
tree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the
monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with
a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he eats it as a
spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce
creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide
how to take care of ourselves when you came among us."</p>

</div><!-- i278 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lion thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Are there any other lions in this forest?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them
all. And, besides, they were none of them nearly so large
and brave as you."</p>

<p>"If I put an end to your enemy will you bow down to
me and obey me as King of the Forest?" enquired the
Lion.</p>

<p>"We will do that gladly," returned the tiger; and all
the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: "We will!"</p>

<p>"Where is this great spider of yours now?" asked the
Lion.</p>

<p>"Yonder, among the oak trees," said the tiger, pointing
with his fore-foot.</p>

<p>"Take good care of these friends of mine," said the
Lion, "and I will go at once to fight the monster."</p>

<p>He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly
away to do battle with the enemy.</p>

<p>The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion
found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his
nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long as the tiger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
had said, and it's body covered with coarse black hair. It
had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long;
but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as
slender as a wasp's waist. This gave the Lion a hint of
the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was
easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring
and landed directly upon the monster's back. Then, with
one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he
knocked the spider's head from its body. Jumping down,
he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when
he knew it was quite dead.</p>

<p>The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts
of the forest were waiting for him and said, proudly,
"You need fear your enemy no longer."</p>

<p>Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their
King, and he promised to come back and rule over them
as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.</p>

with great pieces of rock.</p>

<p>"That will be a hard climb," said the Scarecrow, "but
we must get over the hill, nevertheless."</p>

<p>So he led the way and the others followed. They
had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough
voice cry out,</p>

<p>"Keep back!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow. Then a head
showed itself over the rock and the same voice said,</p>

<p>"This hill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to
cross it."</p>

</div><!-- i286 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"But we must cross it," said the Scarecrow. "We're
going to the country of the Quadlings."</p>

<p>"But you shall not!" replied the voice, and there
stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the
travellers had ever seen.</p>

<p>He was quite short and stout and had a big head,
which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck
full of wrinkles. But he had no arms at all, and, seeing
this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a
creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So
he said,</p>

<p>"I'm sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass
over your hill whether you like it or not," and he walked
boldly forward.</p>

<p>As quick as lightning the man's head shot forward
and his neck stretched out until the top of the head, where
it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent
him tumbling, over and over, down the hill. Almost as
quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and the
man laughed harshly as he said,</p>

<p>"It isn't as easy as you think!"</p>

<p>A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other
rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads
upon the hillside, one behind every rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused
by the Scarecrow's mishap, and giving a loud roar that
echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill.</p>

<p>Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion
went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a
cannon ball.</p>

<p>Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his
feet, and the Lion came up to her, feeling rather bruised
and sore, and said,</p>

<p>"It is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no
one can withstand them."</p>

<p>"What can we do, then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Call the Winged Monkeys," suggested the Tin Woodman;
"you have still the right to command them once
more."</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered, and putting on the Golden
Cap she uttered the magic words. The Monkeys were as
prompt as ever, and in a few moments the entire band
stood before her.</p>

<p>"What are your commands?" enquired the King of
the Monkeys, bowing low.</p>

<p>"Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,"
answered the girl.</p>

<p>"It shall be done," said the King, and at once the
Winged Monkeys caught the four travellers and Toto up
in their arms and flew away with them. As they passed
over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
shot their heads high in the air; but they could not reach
the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her
comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the
beautiful country of the Quadlings.</p>

<p>"This is the last time you can summon us," said the
leader to Dorothy; "so good-bye and good luck to you."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and thank you very much," returned the
girl; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of
sight in a twinkling.</p>

<p>The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy.
There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved
roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks
with strong bridges across them. The fences and houses
and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had
been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and
blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings
themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby
and good natured, were dressed all in red, which showed
bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.</p>

<p>The Monkeys had set them down near a farm house,
and the four travellers walked up to it and knocked at the
door. It was opened by the farmer's wife, and when
Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them
all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds
of cookies, and a bowl of milk for Toto.</p>

<p>"How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?" asked the
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not a great way," answered the farmer's wife.
"Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it."</p>

<p>Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and
walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until
they saw before them a very beautiful Castle. Before the
gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms
trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached
one of them said to her,</p>

<p>"Why have you come to the South Country?"</p>

<p>"To see the Good Witch who rules here," she answered.
"Will you take me to her?"</p>

<p>"Let me have your name and I will ask Glinda if she
will receive you." They told who they were, and the girl
soldier went into the Castle. After a few moments she
came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be
admitted at once.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Before </span>
they went to see Glinda, however,
they were taken to a room of the
Castle, where Dorothy washed her
face and combed her hair, and the
Lion shook the dust out of his mane,
and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best
shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and
oiled his joints.</p>

<p>When they were all quite presentable they followed
the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda
sat upon a throne of rubies.</p>

</div><!-- i296 -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>She was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her
hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over
her shoulders. Her dress was pure white; but her eyes
were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, my child?" she asked.</p>

<p>Dorothy told the Witch all her story; how the cyclone
had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found
her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had
met with.</p>

<p>"My greatest wish now," she added, "is to get back to
Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful
has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning;
and unless the crops are better this year than they
were last I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it."</p>

<p>Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned
face of the loving little girl.</p>

<p>"Bless your dear heart," she said, "I am sure I can tell
you of a way to get back to Kansas." Then she added:</p>

<p>"But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap."</p>

<p>"Willingly!" exclaimed Dorothy; "indeed, it is of no
use to me now, and when you have it you can command
the Winged Monkeys three times."</p>

<p>"And I think I shall need their service just those three
times," answered Glinda, smiling.</p>

<p>Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the
Witch said to the Scarecrow,</p>

<p>"What will you do when Dorothy has left us?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will return to the Emerald City," he replied, "for
Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me. The
only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the
Hammer-Heads."</p>

<p>"By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the
Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald
City," said Glinda, "for it would be a shame to deprive the
people of so wonderful a ruler."</p>

<p>"Am I really wonderful?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"You are unusual," replied Glinda.</p>

<p>Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked:</p>

<p>"What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this
country?"</p>

<p>He leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then
he said,</p>

<p>"The Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me
to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died. I am
fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the
country of the West I should like nothing better than to
rule over them forever."</p>

<p>"My second command to the Winged Monkeys," said
Glinda, "will be that they carry you safely to the land of
the Winkies. Your brains may not be so large to look at
as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than
he is&mdash;when you are well polished&mdash;and I am sure you will
rule the Winkies wisely and well."</p>

<p>Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and
asked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"When Dorothy has returned to her own home, what
will become of you?"</p>

<p>"Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads," he answered,
"lies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there
have made me their King. If I could only get back to this
forest I would pass my life very happily there."</p>

<p>"My third command to the Winged Monkeys," said
Glinda, "shall be to carry you to your forest. Then, having
used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it
to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may
thereafter be free for evermore."</p>

<p>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion
now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness,
and Dorothy exclaimed,</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i299" id="i299"></a>
   <img src="images/i299_edit.jpg" alt="Third wish used on ruby cap" title="Third wish used on ruby cap" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But
you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas."</p>

<p>"Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,"
replied Glinda. "If you had known their power you could
have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you
came to this country."</p>

<p>"But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!"
cried the Scarecrow. "I might have passed my whole life
in the farmer's cornfield."</p>

<p>"And I should not have had my lovely heart," said the
Tin Woodman. "I might have stood and rusted in the
forest till the end of the world."</p>

<p>"And I should have lived a coward forever," declared
the Lion, "and no beast in all the forest would have
had a good word to say to me."</p>

<p>"This is all true," said Dorothy, "and I am glad I was
of use to these good friends. But now that each of them
has had what he most desired, and each is happy in having
a kingdom to rule beside, I think I should like to go back
to Kansas."</p>

<p>"The Silver Shoes," said the Good Witch, "have
wonderful powers. And one of the most curious things
about them is that they can carry you to any place in the
world in three steps, and each step will be made in the
wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels
together three times and command the shoes to carry you
wherever you wish to go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"If that is so," said the child, joyfully, "I will ask them
to carry me back to Kansas at once."</p>

<p>She threw her arms around the Lion's neck and kissed
him, patting his big head tenderly. Then she kissed the
Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most dangerous
to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the
Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,
and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting
from her loving comrades.</p>

<p>Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne
to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked
her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and
herself.</p>

<p>Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and
having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her
shoes together three times, saying,</p>

<p>"Take me home to Aunt Em!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

   <img src="images/i301_edit.jpg" alt="Dorothy and Toto" title="Dorothy and Toto" />
</div>

<p>Instantly she was whirling through the
air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel
was the wind whistling past her ears.</p>

<p>The Silver Shoes took but three steps,
and then she stopped so suddenly that she
rolled over upon the grass several times
before she knew where she was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>At length, however, she sat up and looked about her.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she cried.</p>

<p>For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and
just before her was the new farm-house Uncle Henry built
after the cyclone had carried away the old one. Uncle
Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto
had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the
barn, barking joyously.</p>

<p>Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet.
For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight
through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
